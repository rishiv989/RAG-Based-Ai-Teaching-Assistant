In this video, I will tell you the solution first. After that, I will give a shoutout to all those people who solved this problem. You just like this video and write Sigma batch OP in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so we are going to solve the 17th question now. And here I will show you what the question was. So we have to design this card. And this card is the image of the first video. So I will right click and open image, tap new. And I got this image. So how will I make this layout from tailwind? First of all, I will declare it as an npm project. So I will write npm minute. One thing to note here is that it is not necessary to put minus y every time in npm minute. There was a comment in which someone said that npm minute is also good. npm minute is definitely good because it asks you the package name. Let me name it design the layout. Then it asks that now it says that capital letters cannot be there. So let's fix it. Design the layout. And after that you give a version in it. Let's make it 1.0.0. This is the solution for Sigma exercise number 17. Let's say I write. Then what will be the entry point? Let's say I say yes, index.js will be the entry point. What will be the test command? There is no test command. I don't even want to put git repo. Let's say I want to write sigma javascript tailwind. I write Harry in author. After that, the license is ok. And I say yes, all this is ok. So it will come in my package.json. Whatever details I have entered. Now I will show you how we will set up tailwind css. Like we have set up tailwind css. We will set up the same way. So we will go to this page of tailwind css. Slash doc slash installation. And we will install tailwind css by running this command. And I know this is unnecessary. But I will have to do it. Because I have to make it a tailwind css project. And give you the solution of it. So what we will do is wait. Wait, wait, wait. Tailwind css should be installed once. I hope you can see my terminal. And after this tailwind css init. What happened, I did not copy the code properly. I copied npx tailwind css init properly. Yes, I did it. By doing npx tailwind css init. Your tailwind css con file is made. So here I have made a star. That is, I want to track all the files. And I will do npm i read. And the read is read. Run server. And what happens is that you do not remember the commands. So you just have to write wait in dev. And you have to add a script. And when you add a script in package.json. So what happens. Like suppose I have to run something here. Suppose I say I have to run wait in dev. So if I run npm run dev. So what will it do automatically. This command will run. As you can see that it has run a local server for me. And I will also run the tailwind watch script. Which we used to run every time. So this is my tailwind watch script. So I am saying that watch the input. I will make an src folder. And I will make input.css. In which I will put tailwind css. I am doing repetitive. I am doing a lot of repetitive things. But again I have to set up. And here if I show you my index.html. So it looks like this. Now if I do bg read 50 here. And I write hey here. So this tailwind css should run. It didn't work. And it didn't work because I linked. By doing css. And did not include src.output.css. And now it's on. See what we have to do. We have to make a card from tailwind. It's not a big deal. So if I give a navbar here. Make a very basic navbar. And by flexing ul. And make li here. Write home here. And write about and contact here. Write about. And then write here contact. And then after that. Here I put a main. Inside the main I will say. That div.container. And div.card. And this card. Which will be my card. I will make it. I will do mxauto. And here I will write card here. And what am I trying to do here. Many of you must be thinking. What do you want to do? So let me show you. That I want to make this card. And here is my navbar. In this I display. Sorry. Class is equal to flex. I will write. And I will write class is equal to flex. As soon as I write. Card here is home. About contact. And is my watch script running? Yes my watch script is running. And what will I do here? Dot slash src slash output.css. Okay. So I flexed the navbar. And I also flexed this ul. And here I have written star.html. In the content. So that it only detects html files. Now what will I do here? I will flex the card display first. And I will divide it into two parts. So here I will say. I will give a gap in my card. Suppose I give gap 4. And in this bg slate. I give 950. And I make the text white. So that it looks a bit like this. And in this I can also set the height. Or I can give py. Suppose I give py9. Will it be more? Py9. Yes, it's a little more. Py9. I guess py4 should be fine. And here now I will simply make a card. I am not working on navbar and all. So what will I do? That I will divide this card into two parts. First of all, I will put a display flex in it. And then in this. One part will cover the image. And one part will cover the text. The text will be covered. In that I will give display flex. And I will make the flex direction column. So I made the flex direction column. And here if I see my card again. I have to make this. So I will write the title in it. And here I will write the second text. So the flex direction column I have given. I will make two divs in this. I will write the title in one. And if I make divna and make h1 in it. Then it will be even better. And in that I am installing VS code. And what was the title? I don't remember. And how websites work. And how websites work. And what will we do here? We will make it as sigma web dev course number. We will make it as number one. So here I made it as number one. And after doing this. Let's see how it looks now. So now it will look like this. I have not put image in it. Because this is my image. Which I have to put in src. So once I put this image in src. Which I will put here by putting img. So I put this image. And it is looking like this now. How it is looking? It is looking like this. So this card is made. And I will do one thing. That in the container in which I have put it. I will give it my6. So that it can make some distance. And the text of h1. I will say that bold the font first. And do text excel. I want to make it a little big. And it is looking like this. Maybe 2xl? 3xl? Let's see. 3xl is not too big. But again that depends upon. How big card you want to make. Now if you want to take this text. Which is code with harry. And you want to copy this. Then you copy this. It has given me to copy. It has not given me to do. So I will inspect by right clicking. And I will copy from inside this. What has happened? Right click and copy. And I think I have copied. Okay. And I will bring it like this. Like this. Okay. And after doing this. I think I should be good. Class is equal to. I do text excel lg. Okay. And let's see how it is looking. And according to that I will make it small. And I will give my m y. But I can do one thing here. If I want to bring it to the center. I will see that is it in my layout. Is it in the center or not? So if I come in the image of my layout. Then it is not in the center. It is at the top. And there is a little top margin on it. So I would like to do this. I will give my m y on it. Suppose I gave my m y 4. So it got a little gap in the y axis. And I would like to give it a little gap in the x axis. So I can set a gap here by the way. But what I will do is. I will give mx 4 in this. And if I give mx 4. Then it will shrink a little. And I will give mx 4 in this too. I will give mx 4 in both. And after giving mx 4. It will shrink a little here and there. And if you want it to look exactly like this. Then you have to fix its color. Background. All that. Like you have to black the background. So if you want to go into that much detailing. Then what do you do? Class is equal to bg black in the body. First of all. And text white. Okay. bg black text white. Then it will look like this. Okay. So was there anything else? I guess there was nothing else. If you want to shift the upper ranges. You know what to do. Okay. And the color of this. I would like to make it gray. Because it is white. And here is gray. So how will we do that? There is nothing here. We will write text gray here. And maybe 400. Now you have to see. How much to do? 400 I feel is fine. So this way we can design this card. Exactly we have designed this card. And I hope that all of you. Have designed this card. And I will also give a shout out to all of them. Who solved it. Okay. So I will sort comments by newest. I will scroll down. Very few people are solving the exercise. I scroll and come back. So brother Abhinav RK. Shout out to Shubham Verma. Shout out to Locate Edmure. And they have also done exactly. Like I have done. Exactly the same way. By putting flexbox. They have done very well. There is only one thing. That they have taken 10% in the gap. Maybe you can use tailwind classes. But again if you do 10%. Then there is no problem. Then shout out to Mohit Kumar.
