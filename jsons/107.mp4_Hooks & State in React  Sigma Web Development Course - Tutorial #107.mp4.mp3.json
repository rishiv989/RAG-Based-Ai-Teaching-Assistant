Hooks are basically some functions of React functional components. They enhance capabilities and add some features to it. Like useStateHook provides you with a state. We will see such hooks in the coming videos. But in today's video, we will understand what are hooks and how states can be made in React. You just like this video and write ReactOP in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so we will start by creating a new VEET app. So in video number 107, I will create a new VEET app. And what will I write here? I will go to the VEET website and write VEET. And after writing VEET here, I will click on Get Started. Because I have to create a React app. I will click on React. And I will copy and paste all the commands there. This is the standard way. So let's do npm create VEET at the latest. And what will happen by doing this? A new app will be created here. So I will name the project StateIntro. Because I will tell you about states. I will use the arrow key and select React. After selecting React, I will select JavaScript. And what will I do here? I will go inside StateIntro. This app is basically created by me. So I will open it in VS Code by doing Shift Right. And I will write npm install here. And here I am going to tell you about states and hooks. So see what happens. What happens is that this app has been created as a basic React app. If I run npm dev here, a dev server will open. In which we have got an app of VEET plus React. If you look here, a counter is running. And you will see one most important thing. Whenever we work in React, our page does not reload. Which is amazing. Because whenever we work like this. If you say that the count is 29, then I can also do it by asking question mark count is equal to 2928. But what is happening here is that everything is happening without reloading the page. One of the biggest USP of React is that without reloading the page, you can switch from one page to the other. You can see the example of YouTube. If you click on YouTube, then see the page is not reloading. If you back, then see the page is not reloading. Simply you are coming to the page on which you have to go. And very smoothly only those things change. Which should actually change in the page. For example, if you navigate in YouTube, then the nav bar remains the same. And after that what happens is that this thing remains the same. Which should change, only that thing changes. So what are React hooks? Let's know about this. React hooks are some functions which help us to access React features in the functional component while being in React. What did I say? Let me explain. What happens is that when we make a React app here, then we have to make a state. This is the concept of React state which I will tell you about. But before that I want to let you know what are hooks in general. So hooks in general are some functions. Like this is a use state. This is a function. What does it do? It provides us a state and a function which updates the state. That is, if I wrote count set count and I wrote is equal to use state 0, then it means that make a state called count. Listen to me carefully. Make a state called count. And make the initial value of that state called count 0. The first argument of use state is the initial value. So what will be the initial value of count? It will be 0. And along with that make a function which helps to update this count. So what did I do here? I wrote count set count is equal to use state 0. Which means make a state called count whose initial value is 0. And there should be such a function set count. There should be such a function set count which can update this count. Okay? Are you getting it? So there is a state called count. This is its initial value. And this is a function which I can run and change the state at any time. And whenever I run set count, then what will happen? Then wherever the value of count is, it will be updated. Whatever I gave to set count. Now how to use it? We made a button here. We said count is count. And I do one thing. How about we code it from scratch? Okay? Let's code it from scratch. So what can we do here? We can say that there is a count. I will write here and I will write div. And I will write the count is. Then I will put curly brackets here. Because I am writing a value of JavaScript, count. So I told you in the last video that whenever we have to put a JavaScript variable, then we use curly brackets like this. So what will happen? The count will come after writing 0. You can see here the count is. Now if I refresh, then 0 will come. Okay? So count is 0. Great. Very good. Count is 0. Now what about if I make the initial value of this count 10 and refresh it, then see here, count is 10. Because the initial value of count is 10. Now I am saying that whenever I make a button, now I will say that this is a button. Whenever you click on this button, then the value of count will be updated. So I will make a function called onclick. And we will talk about it later, how to handle events. But for now, bear with me. It is a very simple thing. I have given a function called onclick. So I have put onclick is equal to and then this curly bracket, which means that I am going to write some JavaScript in it. And I will say that I am going to write a function. And I will make that function here. And I will say set count. And I will do count plus 1. So whatever is the initial value of count plus 1. So you see here, update count is done. So it will keep updating like this. I will refresh. The initial value that was given 10 will come again. Okay? So what will the button I made do? First of all, the value of count was 0 here. Okay? Because the value of count was 0 here. So what happened is that 0 came here. The count is 0. Whenever I click on this button, then set count value to count plus 1. Set count count plus 1. Whatever I will give in set count, the value of count will be updated from it. So as soon as I do set count count plus 1, what will happen? The value of count will be 1 from 0, 2 from 1, 3 from 2. If I want, I can also make it minus 1. It is not necessary. Suppose I make initial value 100 and set count minus 1. So it will become a decrement counter. If I refresh, then see, it will go upside down. It is not necessary that it increases. Whatever value I put, if I put a fixed value, suppose I write count multiply by or I make count star star 2. Okay? So if I write 100 here, then what will it do? It will keep increasing. See, it became infinity at one time. Okay? So I am making count equal to count square. Suppose I took 2 of its initial value. And if I refresh it, then initial value is 2. Then it became 4. Then 16, 256. And it is becoming square. Basically, the value. So I can do anything in set count. If I give a constant, suppose 455. So whenever we click on update count, it will become 455. So as simple as that. Whatever you put, in this, state will be updated from there. Okay, many people have confusion in their mind. And it is that why I can't do this. Let A equal to 5. Okay? I say here A. And after doing A, I say here that in this function, many people have this doubt. And I will give the answer. And I say update A. A is equal to A plus 1. So why can't we do this? So we can't do this. Why can't we do this? We can't do this because this is a normal JavaScript variable. We said the count is A. A's value was 5. The count is 5. Display will be done. The matter ends there. Now when we update button on click is equal to A's value, then A's value will be updated. But the value rendered here is done. Okay? What does use state do? Use state updates the value that is being updated. So the work of this hook is that if we update count's value from set count, then wherever count is being used, it will update count there. You can't do this like this. Because once you have... I mean, you understand something like this. There is a JavaScript program. You printed A's value. Once you printed A's value, then the matter is over. It is printed. Now if you changed A's value in the program later, then it will not change. There is no guarantee of this. Because if it was like this, then there is no need for React. We could have done it in our normal JavaScript application. But no, it doesn't happen. Once one thing is rendered, then it happens. But use state makes this thing possible for us. Whenever we run this function, I will revert it again. Whenever we run this function, then the value of our count is updated. So if I wrote here use state 0 and I wrote here set count count plus 1. I will make it normal again. Count plus 1. So you see, I will refresh it. If I refresh it, then the value of count will be updated. So this was our use state. I hope you understood. Now along with use state, there are many other hooks which help us to use additional features of React. Like use ref is one hook. Use context is one hook. There are many other hooks. Hooks in React. And if I talk about React hooks, then will I get a comprehensive list? We will see in the documentation of React. Now see, you can write the hooks of React yourself. But I will not talk about it. We will only talk about built-in hooks. Use state is one hook. See here it is written, hooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in hooks or combine them to build your own. You can also make your own hook. Now see here, state lets a component remember information like user input. As we saw, it remembered the value of count. Whenever we updated it with set count, then our count was updated on our page. Along with that, there are many other hooks. Like use reducer, use context, use ref. There are many hooks. The most important among them is use state and use effect. If I choose my favorite hooks, then because it is always, I will not say always, in most of the applications, it is used. So these are our hooks, use effect and use state. These are among the hooks that are going to be used a lot. And in the next video, we will see the use effect too. But in this video, I just want to tell you that if you want to change the title of this page, then what you can do is go to index.html and change its title. Suppose you are making a to-do app, then you can write to-do list. And if you want to put anything global here, any javascript or css, which you want to come on every page, then you can use it. Then if you want to change the title page by page, then you can do document.titled is equal to. I will tell you all that later that how to make multiple pages, how to link those pages to each other. Now there is only one page. So does react help in making an application of only one page? No, you can make different pages, you can navigate from one page to another. So we will talk about all these things in the coming videos. Now you access this playlist and if you have not given a review in the first video, then please go to the first video and give me a review that how did you like this course. That's all for now in this video. Thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time. Outro Music."}
