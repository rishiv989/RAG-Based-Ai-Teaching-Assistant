You just like this video and write ReactOP in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro So today we are going to talk about the useRef hook. It is a very important hook and for this I will first make a React app. And what I will do here. I will write npm create-v-latest and then it will ask me. So I will write a dot here and here oops I made a mistake here. I had to choose here what I had to choose. I actually had to choose React. So I had to choose React, not vanilla and I had to choose JavaScript. And I will start this app by running npm run dev. Now what is useRef, I will talk about it first. So sometimes what we want is that we make a variable. And make such a variable that persists its value during re-render. Now you understand the meaning of this. I will explain the meaning of this to you. Now you know that we have a state. Now what happens is that whenever we change the state, it triggers a re-render. And I will show you this thing by running npm run dev. So see whenever the value of the count will change, then the basic app here. Whenever the value of the count will change, then the component will be re-rendered. So see here as I am doing this, your component is being re-rendered. And I will show you the proof of this. I will show you the proof of this by using the useEffect snippet. I had told you that this useEffect, if we write something like this. And I write here console.log re-rendering. And this useEffect will run as many times as the component is re-rendered. Now if I show you by inspecting it by right-clicking and refreshing it. It is saying that useEffect is not defined. Oops! UseEffect. And I also import the useRef. I also import the useRef. So here you see that we have a basic app. And in this, the number of times I change the count, the number of times it will be re-rendered. See it is re-rendering. It is coming by writing below. If you can't see it, then I will show you again. I come here in some way. And now you can see very clearly that re-rendering is running here. See, the number of times I click on the count, re-rendering is running here. If I show you again, then see, re-rendering is running. And what is the reason for this? The reason for this is that whenever the state variable changes, then re-rendering happens. Now you will say that I don't want re-rendering to happen whenever my state changes. So what can I do? I can say here let a is equal to. I will say here a is equal to 0. Let's make such variables. And re-rendering and the value of a is. And I will say here. Let's do one thing. Let's use the template literal here. See, I have taught all this. So you guys shouldn't have any problem. And here I will use the template literal syntax and print the same value. So the number of times I do this, the value of a will come to 0. You can see here the value of a is coming to 0. It is very simple. I made a variable here and I showed that variable here. Now listen carefully. Listen carefully to what I am doing. I am not just saying this to say. So count is our state. A is our normal variable. It is a very good thing. I say that whenever it will be rendered, I want to do a is equal to a plus 1. I want to do a is equal to a plus 1. So that the value keeps increasing. So here I refresh it first. And I show you here. The value of a is 2. What is happening? The value of a is 1 again. So I will tell you what happens. What happens is that when this component is re-rendered, this code runs again. And when this code runs again, the value of a becomes 0 again. Here 1 becomes 1. Then the value of count changes. So what happens? This whole component is re-rendered. And because of re-rendering, we are not able to use this normal variable. Its value is not persisting. Because the component is being re-rendered. It is becoming 0 again. So this is the problem. So react gives a user-app hook to solve this problem. React says that you do one thing. Why don't you do a is equal to user-app 0 like this. Put the initial value here. And put a here. I will say that's fine. That's a good thing. But what will be the benefit of doing this? React says that when you do a.current, you will get the value of a. You just have to do a.current. And you can use a.current to correct the spelling of current. If you do a.current is equal to a.current plus 1, then your value will persist across re-render. This is a magic in user-app hook. What does this magic do? The problem that we were using let a while ago will not come. Is it like this? Let's try. If it is like this, then it is a very good thing. We will have to distribute sweets. And here the value of a is also a.current. To reference this, we have to do a.current. Let's see if it is working or not. And the more I run it, the more it is increasing. I would like to say again that we are in strict mode of react. Because of which you can remove it. If you want exactly the production behavior. But you should not remove the strict mode when you are developing. Get used to being in strict mode. And you see here that by doing this, the component is re-rendering. But user-app is doing such a magic that the value of this reference is not changing across re-render. It is a very good thing. Now one more thing happens. Whenever we change the value of this ref, then the use effect is not triggered. That is, it does not re-render. If we change the state, then the component is re-rendered. But if we change the ref, then the component is not re-rendered. This might be confusing for some people. But this happens. So listen to this again. First of all, we made a normal variable. We made a very normal variable. But after that, we saw that whenever we change the count, then the component is re-rendering. And when the component is re-rendering, then our a variable is being re-initialized. Because the whole function is re-rendering. If this code runs again, it will reset the value of a. So that's why react provided us with a use ref hook. With the help of which we made a value persist. So use ref hook gives this guarantee that you give an initial value. And use it by doing a.current. And update it by doing a.current. And if you update, then your value will persist across re-renders. That is, if you have made a.current value 4 here. And your component is re-rendering, then it will remain 4. This code will not re-initialize your variable again. So this is what use ref means. So this is one use case of use ref. So what I will do to this app.jsx. In fact, I will copy it here. And I will do this. app.app.jsx I am doing this for you so that you get this code. So here this use case 1 is done. Now I will show you what is use case 2 of ref. The use case 2 of ref is that what we will do. You must know this use effect. Which runs only once on the first re-render. What we will do here is that we will say a is equal to use ref. We said a is equal to or we will say ref is equal to use ref. And I will remove this from here. And I will remove this too. I will do re-rendering here. Or I do one thing. First. I will do rendering. And what I will do here. The ref is equal to ref I will say div. Or I do one thing, I do this button. button ref is equal to ref. So I can ref this button like this. Now listen what I did. I said const ref is equal to use ref. And I said here ref is equal to ref. Means whenever I have to reference this button. I don't have to do DOM manipulation. I can reference it directly with the name ref. So if I do something like this here. In use effect I will say ref.current.style.background.color is equal to red. So what will happen? Its background color will be red. So I will refresh it. As soon as it is re-rendered for the first time. Its background color will be red. You understood what is happening and why. And how is it happening. You are understanding everything. I hope you are understanding this thing. So this is what happens. Nothing more than this happens. So what you can do. You can also make multiple refs. So I can name it btnref. If I remember that this is button ref. I will give the name of the ref. And here I will say ref is equal to btnref. So I am saying that I will call it btnref. I can call it in any code. So whenever I want to click somewhere else. I can use this reference. So this is our ref. So I will do btnref here. For it to work correctly. And if I refresh it. Its background color is red. Otherwise what I had to do. I had to do DOM manipulation. We don't do that in React. We use this type of refs. So this is another use case of ref. So I have told you one use case. Why we will use ref. Because it's value persists. Across re-renders. I have told you another use case. That we can access any DOM element. By doing ref.current. Anywhere. In any code. If I want to make a new button. I am just showing you. And I will call it btnref. And I will name it changeB. And I will say. OnClick is equal to. I want this arrow function to run. And what will happen in this function. I will say btnref.current.style.display. Is equal to. None. So I can do this. If I click on changeB. Then this button will disappear. If I refresh. Then it will disappear. So ref is used most. In this kind of work. When we write react code. That I have to access one element. Again and again. I can make a ref of that. And by doing ref.current. I can reference that element. Now I want to bring you. On documentation of react-use-ref. Because there are some things. Which are very important. And I want to show you. How well it is written in documentation. Here are some shortcuts. You can change ref.current. But by changing. Your component will not be re-rendered. If it holds an object. That is used for rendering. Then you shouldn't mutate that object. So what is he saying. If you have made a ref. As we saw in the first example. We made a ref named a. He is saying. Don't use a here. We made a count. He is saying. You can't display ref like this. Because whenever ref changes. Then component will not be re-rendered. So your value will not be updated. For that you use state. You will use ref. When your value is not being used. In the DOM. Or you want to change it. And at the same time. You want to persist its value. Then you will use ref. I hope this thing is clear to you. Then here it is written. That by changing ref.current. Component will not be re-rendered. He is saying. Don't manipulate ref.current. And the thing I told you. That in strict mode. Your component function works twice. And I told you that. But strict mode works only in development. You should use strict mode. Now here are some examples. Which I want to show you. Examples of re-referencing a value. Here is an example. Of click counter. You clicked once. Then it will be two times. Then it will be three times. So what is happening. We are running a function. And even if the component is being re-rendered. The value of ref.current is persisting. But the value of ref.current. Is not used here. Because if we use it here. Then the component will not be re-rendered. And the value will not be updated. So you can start stopwatch. And you can stop stopwatch. What has been done here. Use ref has been used. To store the time. And then interval ref. He has made a ref. In which he has initialized interval ref. With a set interval. So you can see this thing. You can run the example closely. If you click on fork. Then the whole window opens. You can practice there. I want you to see these four examples. One example is. If you click here. Then it will focus on it. So what he did. He made ref equal to input ref. And then he said whenever you click on it. Ref.current.focus. So here he has done the DOM manipulation. Without referencing any element. As I showed you. Then after this. Scrolling an image into view. This is a very good example. If you click here. Then this one comes in view. You can click on fork and see this example. And see how an image note is being brought into view. So through react. Very good apps can be made. Because of all these things. So you must see these examples. And the rest of the use ref is this. I hope you understood. If you have not accessed the playlist of sigma. Then do access it. Once again, sigma course is getting a lot of love. And let me tell you. You don't need to watch this video. This is not my claim. This is my guarantee. When I made 20-25 videos. I was hesitating to say this. But now I have made more than 100 videos. And those videos are very good. I am pretty confident. After doing sigma course. You can make any kind of website. Because the concepts are basic. I have cleared it for you. So do access this playlist. Thank you so much for watching this video. Thank you so much."}
