Here, we will use the map method of JavaScript. It will be fun. Like this video and write react in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So, today we will see how to render a list in conditional. So, I will open the terminal in VS Code. And after opening the terminal, I will write here npm create read latest and after doing this, we will write a dot here. And here, keeping the name of the project the same, what we will do is we will make a react app. And after making the react app, we will choose JavaScript and install npm. And after this, we will run this app. And I will tell you how to render a list in conditional. And after that, I will tell you how to render a list. So, this is a standard method in react. And you will use this method multiple times. And don't ask why we did this repeatedly. Why didn't we install FLs? You can understand that what I am going to tell you in this video you will use it in almost every big react app. The method of conditional rendering is all in JavaScript. But the technique I am going to tell you in this video, you have to watch it carefully. So, in src, we have app.jsx. And we will run our script by writing npm run dev so that a port will be exposed on the local host. And we will see this. We saw this. Now, suppose I want that there is a button here. And before that, I will make a state. And I will name that state showButton. showBtn and setShowBtn. This is showBtn and this is setShowBtn. showBtn and setShowBtn is equal to useState of false. Suppose, its default value is false. The default value of showBtn is false. Now, what I will do is I want that if the value of showBtn is true, then only my button will be visible. So, suppose I make a button here. And I will say that this button will be visible only then I will be shown only when second another button is clicked. I will write something like this. Yes, I know that a very big button has been texted. And it will look like this. A very big button has been texted. You won't get to see such a big button text. But let's have it. I want this button to be visible only when showBtn is true. So, what can be done about this? I can say that, look, I will write JavaScript first. So, I will put it in a curly bracket because I want to show it. After this, I will write here that, look, if I use a ternary operator in showBtn, I will write, if showBtn is true, if it is true, then return this. Then show this. Otherwise, what should I do? Otherwise, don't show anything. Or else, show this. So, if showBtn is not true here, then this will come. If I make showBtn true here, if I make it true, then this button will be visible. So, this is a ternary operator, which we all have read in JavaScript. And here curly bracket came because why curly bracket came here? Because we are writing JavaScript. Whenever we are writing JavaScript, we have to write curly bracket to tell that we are writing JavaScript. So, this thing happened. So, everyone must have understood this. So, this is a conditional rendering. But suppose I don't want to write a ternary operator. So, I can do this. Write it like this. Is there any easy way to do this? I want showBtn to be true, then only the button will be visible. Otherwise, nothing should be visible. So, if I show you by inspecting the element here, by right-clicking and inspecting the element, then see, the button is visible. The button is visible. And if I make it false, then what will happen? Then nothing is visible here. See, this is coming directly after the beat. So, this thing will solve our purpose that we want to do. But there is a way to make it better. What should you do? You write. First of all, we are writing JavaScript because we will put curly bracket. I will zoom for mobile users. Because a lot of people here watch on mobile. Now why do they watch? I don't know. But a lot of people watch on phone. Now here I have put curly bracket. After putting curly bracket, I will say showbtn ampersand ampersand and after this I will put this button. I will only be shown when the second button is clicked. Something like this. So, what does this mean in JavaScript? It means that if showbtn is true, then show this. So, this translates somewhere that if showbtn is true, then return this. Otherwise, return nothing. So, basically I am saying that if showbtn is true, then show this. So, this is a way to see this syntax in many places in React applications. That showbtn ampersand ampersand and after that if showbtn is true, then this thing will be shown. Otherwise, it will not be shown. Like you see here it is not being shown because showbtn is false. Now I want that as soon as I click on count, showbtn should be toggled. Okay? So, I do one thing. I will do it here in onclick. showbtn set showbtn and I will remove this count. Forget the count once. Let's remove it. Because this is a count application. Let's remove it. And here what I will do is I will say showbtn not of set showbtn not of showbtn. That means if showbtn is true, then false it. If false, then true it. So, you see as soon as I click here, showbtn is true. That's why it is coming like this. Then I will click again. It is gone. I will click again. So, showbtn is true. So, it came. So, here I am basically saying that if showbtn is true, then show this. Otherwise, don't do anything. Okay? But sometimes we have to do something otherwise. Okay? So, here if I am saying that I will write it like this. Showbtn is true. Okay? Assume I write it like this. So, here showbtn is true. See, showbtn is true. And if I want showbtn is false if this thing is true, then I will use the above syntax. Then in that case, what I will do is I will write something like this. I will show you. Here showbtn is true. Showbtn is true. Showbtn is true. Showbtn is true. Showbtn is true. Showbtn is true. Otherwise, what will happen? Otherwise, I will show the button showbtn is false. So, if you want to use else, then you will use this ? operator. So, this is the conditional rendering. Now, if you are not a beginner, if you are not a beginner, then all these things will be easy for you because this is the concept of JavaScript. I have not put any rocket science in this. So, here I will click on count. It is toggling true, false, true, false. You can see on the screen. True, false, true, false, false, true, false, true, false. So, here the text count is toggle I will say toggle showbtn. I can call it toggle showbtn. So, here toggle showbtn will be seen. And see here it is changing because I have put a ternary operator here. So, you have to remember this syntax. You have to remember this one too. You have to remember both. Fine. So, this is done how we use our ternary operator and how conditional rendering is done. So, this kind of conditional rendering is done. I want to tell you one more thing. Here we are talking about conditional rendering. So, we can make a component like this. We can say const todo is equal to and we can say that const todo is equal to something like this. Fine. And here I will write div.todo and I will write imtodo and after this I have made const todo is equal to here. I have made a todo component. I can use this component where? I can use above this card like this todo and I will close it like this. And I have to make a function of this. So, I will do one thing. To make a function of this, what I will do is I will make something like this like this and here it will be like this. Fine. So, I said const todo is equal to this and I will return this. Fine. So, I will do like this and refresh it. So, you can see here imtodo will come. So, if I have to make something like this small component then I can make within it also. It is not that I have to put it in the components folder only. I am just telling you for your information by documenting the format. The work we are doing with this function app what is a component? It is a simple function. Fine. So, I want to tell you this also. Although you will do this work very less. Fine. Now I will tell you that how we can use a list. So, I do one thing. Here I write imtodo title. Fine. So, I will write title and I will make small todo here. And it will take todo. Fine. Now I will do one thing. I will do like this. It is taking props. So, todo is taking a prop. todo.title is done. And after this todo.desc will come. Fine. So, I will write div. Let's say todo and I will write todo.desc here. And I am not designing this card but you can design it. Now I can do one thing here. I can say const and I will do state snippet. And I will write todo set todo is equal to and here I will take an initial value of todo. Here will come a title and here will come hey and here will come desc I am a good todo will come here. Fine. So, like this by putting comma what we will do we will write like this. And I will write hey another todo and I will write good todo 2 and I am grocery todo I will write I am a good todo but I am a grocery todo. I have taken a random one. Fine. I have done todo set todo. Now let's say I want to display all the todos. How will I do it? Fine. So, what can I do here? I will need a for loop. Let's say I want to display all the todos. I will need a for loop. So, how will I put a for loop? So, to render a list in JavaScript in fact in React not in JavaScript in React to render a list we use a special technique. And that is what we do first we put a curly bracket then we write todos.map we say todos.map then we run a function in the map and this is item. Basically, it is an arrow function. I said item and here we will return a todo. Fine. And here I will return it like this. I will return the todo component like this. And I will give three things here. First of all, what I will do I will write here title is equal to and I will write item.title and I will give here to do instead of item I will give to do so I will write todo.title todo.title Fine. Here, maybe I can give only todo is equal to todo Yes, it is taking a todo prop so I can give todo is equal to todo so it will work. So, I will give here todo is equal to todo because it is taking a todo prop. So, I gave todo is equal to todo and if I will see then see Hey, I am a todo Hey, another todo I am a todo So, this is done. Now, I will do one thing that is, what I will do I will wrap this whole in a div and in this div I will give div.m4 and along with that I will give border1 Fine. And I will wrap this whole in this way. Let's see whether it came here or not. It didn't come. Why didn't it come? I don't know why it didn't come. I didn't use tailwind in this Okay. You can use tailwind in global.css You basically have to use tailwind here. Let's use tailwind. I will quickly complete the setup of tailwind and come. So, I In fact, I will do it in this video so that you can also see how I am using tailwind in my project quickly. It is also important for you to see. So, I did this here and after doing this I will use the second command after using the second command Come on, come on fast We have less time. We have less time. Clock is ticking. This is a copy I will copy this in tailwind.config.js I will paste it like this and then I will copy this and after copying this I will put it here and after this I will do npm run dev so what will happen that this is not working what happened What kind of joke is this E is not working Actually, I should have specifically clicked on the framework guides and clicked on the wheat and here I have to auto-click on the wheat and here I should have installed auto-prefixer and post-css so for whichever framework you are doing you must see the framework guide because if you don't see the framework guide then you will have a problem so now I will do npm run dev so it will work so here you have to ensure that you run all these commands once again which are specifically for wheat then your tailwind will work so you have to ensure that you run all these commands once again and you should see that the tailwind will work so now I will run npm run dev so I have installed npm run dev so I have installed npm run dev so I have installed npm run dev so I have installed npm run dev so now I have installed npm run dev so so I have installed npm run dev so I have installed npm run dev so now let's look at the best way to use the npm run dev so we so what i will do here ideally we should choose a title id or a serial number which is guaranteed unique but for now i will give it a title ideally i should give an id here but for now you will see that as soon as i refresh it, this error has gone which means that it is working very well so now all the to dos are displayed so this way we can render a list and in any format now it is not necessary to make a component and render it i want to copy this whole thing i just want to show you that you can do this too i can cut this here i just told you that you can make a component in the same file but ideally we don't do this we will return this here and here we will do to do.title and to do.dsc i will just do a format document here and i will not remove this comment so that you can see this method you can remove this comment and see now i will tell you a caveat here everything is going well now here an error has come i will refresh it i will put a key here and i will put a key here so this error will also go so now there is no error now i want to tell you one thing suppose you have pressed enter then the return will be blank and it will ignore it so if you want to do something like this then you bring this up so that it returns this div either you do it like this or if you say that i will do it like this then you wrap it in a parenthesis so that this whole thing returns and bring this parenthesis up like this otherwise the return will be blank so you have to keep this thing in mind otherwise you will have a problem so you have to keep this thing in mind so i hope you have understood the conditional rendering there are three takeaways of this video the first takeaway is that you can do rendering like this and the second takeaway is that you can do rendering like this so the two main ways of rendering which i have told you that you will do a lot in react one is this and one is this you will do this when you want to use if else show btn true or false we have used ternary operator so this is one type of conditional rendering then we saw how to render a list through map then react demands that you give a unique key prop so whatever is unique in your item you can put it as key is equal to if you think more about it so this is a requirement react needs a unique attribute you can say it like this it needs a unique attribute in div it needs a key prop but in a simplified html language it needs a unique attribute so key is equal to to do.title because to do.title is unique if it was id, i would have given id but if there is nothing unique in my list then what should i do i don't have any guarantee that my title or description is unique so you need to make something unique in your list so wherever you are fetching data, get something unique react says i don't know, give me something unique and if you don't have anything unique, then put it in your data and then give it to me so here we have displayed all the title, description and other things that's about it, i hope you understood i hope you understood this so that's it for this video we have done a lot of things whenever you are using tailwind css whatever framework you are using select it and then follow the steps like when you are using wheat you need to use post css and auto prefixer and you don't need watch command so keep this in mind and everything works smoothly if you haven't accessed this playlist yet, then do it thank you so much for watching this video and i will see you next time music"}
