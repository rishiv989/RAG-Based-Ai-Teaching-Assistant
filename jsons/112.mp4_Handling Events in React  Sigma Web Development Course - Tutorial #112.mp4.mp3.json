batch off in the comment section below Let's go to the computer screen Let's roll the intro Intro So I have come to my computer screen where I have made a folder named video112 I will not write anything here, I will write npm create beat latest and put a dot And here in the name of video112, I will choose react in the project By choosing javascript, I will do npm i and npm run dev Our basic counter app will be made How to handle events in react How to handle events in react, if we leave it, we will talk about javascript How were we doing in javascript to handle the event What we used to do was add event listener There was a little pain What do I mean when I say pain I mean that we had to make a separate event handler Which used to run independently in our javascript file What is in react, in jsx I will clear it all I will clear all of this I will clear it all And here I will write a very simple Dev.button Okay And here a button tag and here I will write click me And as soon as I click me, I don't need to write an event listener here What can I do in react, I can say that OnClick is equal to And VS code helps us a lot in auto completing And as soon as you write on You wrote on, so many events are available to see below VS code is telling which event you want to handle So I am showing all the events on drag and capture I am saying that in onclick, I have to run a function called handleClick So I have written handleClick here And this handleClick function I will call it an arrow function So I will make an arrow function And after making this arrow function I will write here, let's say alert Hey I am clicked I am clicked Okay And my app is running here on localhost Localhost is not running on 3000 It is running on some other port, it is running on 5173 And I have written click me here So hey I am clicked came So I have handled the click event It is a very good thing Now let's say I make another div here And I want to be on mouse in that div Let's say I write here div.red And I write here I am a red div And I will come to my index.css And this dot red class which I have just referenced I will say that Background it red Color it white And with that height it 233 pixels width 344 pixels Okay, so after doing all these things Here is an I am a red div Now I want anyone to take their mouse on it So what will happen I will say onMouseOver Is equal to handleMouseOver Assume I have a handle Mouse over and made a function here So I simply In the name of handleMouseOver I will write I am a mouse over I will document the format So basically I can write functions like this If I want I can also make arrow function here But what happens is that JSX gets bloated So we don't want our JSX to be bloated So it's just that simple One thing about Suhabad It's just that simple I will take the mouse inside it Here I am mouse over I took the mouse inside it Now if I want I can show you all the events But it's as simple as this I am telling you There is a little different thing here And that is that I wrote input type is equal to text I can say here that input type is equal to text There is a special case of input in react When we use forms I wrote an input here Now I am typing anything here Now I want to make a state of whatever I am typing And I am here using the useState snippet And I am here using the useState snippet I will write Value set value is equal to And here I Name it I will name it I will write name And I will write Name set name and useState And let's start with an initial name Harry And I want this value I will name it like this So here you see its value is name Its value is name I am not able to change it You will type it with the keyboard Why am I not able to change it What kind of joke is this All events are running So what we have to do for this When this input changes Run a function called handleChange And you will use this a lot In react I can say this with confidence If you are working with react You will have to make this handleChange with inputs So here I made a handleChange Whenever there is a change I will simply write Set value I will set name here Because we have to change the name And I will say whenever there is a change Set name whatever The value will be written by changing Now I will show you one thing Here the way we can Take event in addEventListener Here also we can take event with e So what I will write here Set name e.target.value So e.target.value Set name So what will happen by doing this Our problem will be solved So I wrote here harry If I write here rohan Or if I write here shubham So now I am able to type Earlier I was not able to type Why not able to do This red handle mouse is getting annoying I am removing this So what was happening here Earlier I was typing Now I am able to type Why do we have to do this It happens that when you Name value is equal to name Then react takes this thing to heart And says that you have named value So it will remain harry But one thing happens When you change name with keyboard Like we have done Harry instead of y So onChange will be fired And for a split second Its value will be Harr And we will say e.target.value Change name And value is equal to When it will be re-rendered You can consider this as a convention You can consider it as a way To do this Because if you ask me this question How did you know that you have to do this So while doing it To be very honest I have seen in documentation And after seeing in documentation I came to know that yes this also happens And if any developer is working in react So they too have seen this thing In documentation And after that they understood So there are two or four things like this Which you have to remember I never want to tell you out of the blue That I am such a genius That I have invented this technique This is a standard input practice Which is a practice with input tags Which is followed among developers Now assume you have one more input And there are inputs There are different inputs I copy this And what will I do here Assume I put name is equal to Assume this is email And here I will put name is equal to password Name is equal to password Now type is equal to will also put password here And I do one thing Assume we want to keep a phone number But type is equal to phone should be But for now let's assume text Value is equal to here I say Assume phone is done Or I will put form.name Form.name and here I will do Form.phone And I make form a state Instead of creating this as a state I say const Or I use useState snippet Form set form is equal to Form set form is equal to Here I will write useState An empty object And here I say Form.name Blank name for now And blank phone Assume I did something like this Here we will do value is equal to form.name Value is equal to form.phone Both are blank for now When we will on change, see I made these two inputs Now I will type anything here, it is not happening I will type anything here, it is not happening Why it is not happening? Because Form.name is blank So it will remain blank But one thing will happen when you will try to change this So your handle change Function will run And when it will run, then what will happen That you are setting name E.target.value When you are setting name And when you are setting name Then it will show an error So if you will open console Then you will see an error Set name is not defined So how we will tackle this problem There is a way to tackle this What we will do, we will say set form Now see here You can put if else If name is changed, if e.target.value Name is e.target.name You can also do e.target.name Means if you will do e.target.name Then what you will get for this You will get email and phone for this Before moving ahead, I will tell you That we will get the value of email and phone from e.target.name By doing e.target.value The value that has changed Means if I Press G in my keyboard Then e.target.value will be G Or whatever value I added I wrote Harry in it, I put G in front of it So it will be Harry G Now see what I am doing What we will do, we will say Set form is equal to Our form Dot dot dot form And by putting comma We will do something like this e.target.name And we will write here e.target.value What did you do So I want to show you first That it works, it works, if we will reload it There is no error, you can see And I will come here So that you can see clearly Now see I wrote here Harry at code with Harry, let's say I write here I am not able to type, let me see what's wrong Something is wrong, still something is still wrong So I did dot dot dot form here I said take form And instead of e.target.name Take e.target.value, ok Set form e.target.name e.target.value And I made a mistake here That I have taken name and phone here But I have taken name and phone here too But here I have done name is equal to email So I will do one thing Name is equal to I have done email here, so I will do email here too Because if we are taking email and phone Then I will not write name and phone here, I will write email and phone So you guys get rid of this confusion Form.email will come here, name will not come Now let's try to type here Let's reload, now let's try to type Suppose I wrote harry at code With harry.com And then I wrote phone here 88888 I can do one thing here, if I show you a console log And I write here That I will console log this form So what will happen, I will show you When I will console log the form I will reload it, suppose I wrote here Harry at code with harry and then I wrote d Or I write anything here Hey and here I write aaa So what will happen here, hey will be its value And aaa will be its value Now many of you will have a question here When you wrote hey here Why he came, I will show you again I will write hey here, so only he came And when I will write phone here So what will happen Suppose I wrote phon So this hey came later and this phone But it did not complete, but if I give space here In hey, then this phone will be completed See phone is complete, hey and phone Hey space and phone What is going on here So I will tell you what is going on What happens is when we Set target.name to e.target.value So e.target.value Value of e.target.value What will happen Whatever we typed In this case, what will happen, hey will be Okay, here the phone will be But when we run setform, then setform Asynchronous and takes some time to run So console.log The form runs before the finish of the setform So here you You are getting to see he You are not getting to see hey, so here you If you write hey, then you will get to see he But if you After a while, if you type something in the phone, then You will get this hey completed because by then Setform would have been run And you can find these concepts A little difficult, but I want to tell you It comes while doing it I will recap this concept again See here I have used the input tag I said that brother, see I have a Form object and There is email and phone in it, I used email Used here in value, used form here Sorry, I used the phone here Then after that I said both Change, then handle change run, but here In the handle change, I said that brother, see Form the set, the form object But the e.target.name Will be That is, the name attribute of this That is, email or phone, wherever it came from The change that has triggered Do its value Whatever its changed value, that is, whatever We have updated, I hope you have understood this thing And if you have not understood this thing I want you to do it, do it in actual Write this syntax with your own hands Just don't look and say that it is very difficult I can't do it, and the first time you see You may feel that yes, I can't do it It is difficult, but let me tell you One thing, listen to me In such forms, you will do it in every form I am saying that you will do it in almost every form I can't say that you will do it in every form But you will do it in almost every form Whatever you make in react, and this concept After learning once, you will use it in your Journey forever So keep this in mind And there are very few concepts like this It is a bit complex, complex to grasp I will say yes, it is a bit complex to grasp But once you have grasped it, you have understood this thing How to handle multiple inputs From the same handle change function Once you understand this thing Then your work will be very good And you will have a lot of fun, now I will show you one thing If I do this to the use state I declare an empty object to this form So what will happen in form.email, an error will come It will say that my form.email is not there So I will type anything here See a warning is coming Form.email is not there So what will I do, I will write here Question mark dot email, question mark dot phone This is one way, but I can do one more thing What can I do I will say that if form.email is there If form.email is there So what should I do Put form.email Otherwise what should I do If this is there, then put form.email Otherwise what should I do Put blank here, I will put phone here So what will happen if form.email exists Form.email will come here Otherwise a blank string will come So see I will reload it If I type anything here, then the warning that was coming So this way we Handle form in react It is a small concept, I hope you understood It is not easy to grasp But this one is easy to grasp Handle mouse over, you handle events like this Different You can handle all kinds of events like this By making a lot of applications There is a special case in input Of handle change function And we will do a lot of projects So you guys grasp this thing Do a little hard work on it Try to do it, I tell you again That we have filled the name attribute here HTML name attribute This is the value attribute of HTML We said that whenever it is changed So trigger this function so that it Change this form, change this state So that it is completely re-rendered Then go to form.email And form.phone Whoever fired it, the event will change Okay, I hope it is clear You have understood the concept So that's all for this video
