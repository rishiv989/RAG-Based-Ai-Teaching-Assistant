All the applications had only one page. We used to edit app.jsx only. And that was our single page entry point. But in today's video, I'll tell you how to make a multi-page application using React router in React. When we make multi-page applications in React, then while navigating, our page doesn't get reloaded. We'll see what are the concepts in this video. You can like this video and write React in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So first, I'll make a V project. By pressing shift and right click, my VS code and VS code is opened. And the same command that we are running to make our V project. And in this, the minus minus tailwind flag doesn't work. So if you want to include tailwind, then you have to include tailwind separately. Just so that you know. Okay. I'll make it a tab here. And I'll zoom in a little and write a dot here. The name of the project is going to be video 115. React, JavaScript and NPM I. And I'm showing this step because in case someone watches the video from the middle and just wants to know about the router, then he knows how I have set up the project. So I'll run NPM run dev by doing NPM I. And here I'll come to app.jsx. So why do we use React router here? The first thing I want to tell you is the problem with traditional anchor tag. What's the problem with anchor tag? Why can't we do this? Make a navbar. So I'll do one thing. I'll make a navbar here in src. component slash navbar dot jsx. And here this folder will be made. And we can do something very easily. Write rafce. And here we say that, make our navbar. Write navbar, write li. Write home here. And make a lot of copies of this too. And write an anchor tag here. And write href is equal to. One minute, I have to write the anchor tag like this. Write href is equal to slash. And after this, press shift and control. You can also type manually. I am using some ninja techniques here. And I hope you know all these ninja techniques. If you use alt key, then multiple cursors are made. This we have discussed a lot in our course. So if I write home here, write about here, write contact here, then what will happen? And I will also include this navbar here. I will also include this navbar here. And I will import the navbar. So the biggest problem that will come, what will I get? If I click on home, then you can see here, you will know that this page is being reloaded. But I don't want our page to be reloaded whenever we click on home, about, contact anywhere. Obviously I don't want this to happen. So how will I save myself from this? How can I change the page content and my page doesn't get reloaded? How will I do this? I will do this by using React Router. So what I will do is open my terminal and write here npm i react router dom. You see the spelling is react router dom. So you have to use this spelling exactly. React router dom. And your React router will be installed. And you restart the server. It's always a good practice to restart the server. And what you do here? Import create browser router from react router dom. Now this browser router, is recommended to use. There are other ways to use react router. But this is the latest and recommended way. So you click on create browser router, I mean, import it. And then you create a new router here. So I will write here const router is equal to create browser router. And I will give an array in it. And the array will be of objects. Which objects? I will tell you which objects. So what we will do here? We will say router is equal to create browser router. And we will give an array. And we will say router is equal to create browser router. And I will not do this in navbar. I will do this in app.jsx. So I have made a quick change here. And I will remove all this from here. I hope you are not confused. I really hope you are not confused about this. I will tell you again. Just so that you get confused. And I will do this here. Router is equal to this. I will do the thing I did in navbar by mistake. So I will show you exactly what we are doing here. So what we did? We imported navbar in objects. So that our navbar can be displayed here. Which we have displayed here. I will display a div here. I will leave the div here. You can do it if you want. You can write here. So you will see the content here. So you will see the content here. We have made a very normal page. Which is not rocket science. We will say router is equal to create browser router. And the object here will have two things. One will be path. One will be path. One will be element. So we are saying path is slash. Then what will be the element? Element will be a component. So we will name it home. So I will make a component here. So I will make a component here. I will do rafce. And then I will write here. I am home. And here I will write. Something like this. And I will import home. So here it will be. Import home from components home. So I am basically saying that when you come to the slash path. Then show the home element. And I make one more path. Suppose I make login here. So I am saying login. So I want to open a login page. So I will do the element. What will I do? Login. Login.jsx Rafce And after this login. And obviously we have to import login. Import login. Did you find it fast? Do you feel that I am going fast? I am not going fast because I have covered all these things many times. Repeatedly. I just want to make sure that your time is not wasted. So here you see we made a router. We have not used it. We have to use it obviously. So we made a router. And after this what we did? We returned it and did it like this. Now see you will not remember all these things. Now let's go to the documentation of React Router. And if anything changes. I will go to examples. I will go to tutorials. And here what I am using. Create browser router. I got the example here. So I used one create browser router. I will use router provider. So one is create browser router. And one is router provider. What is this router provider? Basically wherever you want these elements to fit. These components to fit. Not elements sorry. Components should fit. Wherever you want to fit your components. There you will put this. Router provider. How will you put it? Router provider is equal to this. So what I will do? I will remove this. I will put it under nav bar. Router provider is equal to router. So basically I am saying that. When you come to slash. Then what will you do? If you come to slash login. Then you will show login. Maybe I will make one more component. About. It is a very repetitive task. So my hand will move fast. And here I have made about. And I will do the same thing. If anyone goes to slash about. Then he will see the component about. So I will write about here. And I will import it. I will import about. I will write a and b. I have made a basic application. Now I am clicking on home. I am clicking on about. Page is being reloaded. So if I use anchor tag. Which I am using. I say that slash home. I am doing one thing. I will make login. If I write slash login. Then my login component will open. I am clicking on home. I am clicking on about. I am clicking on login. But there is a problem. My page is being reloaded. If you will see youtube. If you will click on home. Then page will not be reloaded. You have to see here. If I will do back. Then page will not be reloaded. So I want that in react app. My page is being reloaded. So we are using react router. Otherwise we would have used anchor tag. But here react router. Gives us a facility. Which will not be able to reload our page. And the name of that facility is link. Basically we will use a link. And here we will replace anchor tag. With link. So where it is written a. We will use link tag. And we will use to instead of href. So I will do change occurrences. And I will make it to instead of href. So I will use link and to. On run time it will be converted. In anchor tag. So don't think that. New HTML element is introduced. Nothing like that. It will be converted in anchor tag. I will show you. So I will do back. And I will inspect it. What is the problem. Ideally we do all this work. In main.jsx. Browser routers. We do it in main.jsx. So that our whole app gets routing. But for now I will cut navbar. And I will put navbar here. And I will wrap it in react fragment. Like this. So what I am doing here. I am wrapping it in react fragment. And now I will show you my app. So it is running. I am clicking on home. I am clicking on about. I am clicking on login. Obviously I have not designed it. But you got the point. Clicking on home. Clicking on about. Clicking on login. So this is the basic of routing. So the most basic thing. If you want to use router. If you want to use react router. You can do it from here. Now suppose I have another. Route here. And that would be slash profile. Or slash user. And after that here. I want to use the parameter. What I do. And suppose this is my user component. I will make it quickly. And after doing rafce. What I will do here. I am user. And here the user name. Suppose I want to use this variable. So here username. I want to use the variable username. So I can't use it like this. If I want to get this user name variable. So what I want. I want to go to slash user slash Harry. So I want to get Harry. So what I will do. I will take this variable here. And this is a parameter. And I will write here. Import use params. Use params. From react router dom. And I will write here. Const params is equal to. Use params. And I will do something like this. And here I will do params dot. Username. And as soon as I do this. I will get my username here. And I will refresh it quickly. Let me see why this error is coming. User is not defined. Actually I have not done import user. I have not done import user. And here I am user Harry. And my navbar is also here. And I am user Harry. If I write here. Rohan then I am user Rohan. If I write here Shubham. I am user Shubham. If I write here Divya. Then I am user Divya. So if we want to do dynamic routing. Then we can do something like this. So this is our dynamic routing. Now I do one thing. I remove all styles here. And you see. This is also my navbar. I will write a little CSS here. I will not write much. I will flex the display. I will make a gap. Assume 34 pixels. It will be made like this. And I will put star here. I will make P0 and M0. So that padding margin becomes zero. And I will also make the background of the nav. Assume black. And I will make the color white. And I will make the font. Leave font1. I am not putting font1. I will make the li here. List style none. So our navbar will look like this. Now it is fine. Why is its color not white? I will have to do anchor tag. Color. Color white. So I made its color white. And here I will have to remove app.css. Because it is being imported. And now my navbar looks like this. Why is my anchor tag not white? I did not put colon in color. And now I will give padding here. I will give padding. I will give padding. 0 pixels and sorry. I will give overall. I am getting the problem of padding 23 pixels. Why is it not white? Why is this anchor tag not white? Li is inside a. So the li inside a. I have to make its color white. And yes it is white. So I wanted to make a navbar. And here I am user Divya is coming after writing. Assume that I want that my active link comes in red color. Assume that I am on home, then it becomes red. If I am on about, then it becomes red. This is a very basic use case. We want it to be like this. So what we will do for that? We will come back here. And instead of using link, I will come to my navbar.jsx. We will use navlink. So what is navlink? One benefit of navlink is that you can put a class name here. Class name is equal to. And you can write a function here. Something like this. And I am telling you what I am doing here. So I am saying here is an element. And I will do return. And element dot. I guess is active. Is active. If I am not wrong. If it is active. Then what will we return? Assume that we will return red. Otherwise we will return nothing. I hope I have done it right. So what I have done is I have put a function in class name. And I said that if it is an active element. Then what should I do? Then you give red class. Otherwise don't give. I will define red class too. And I should have written red class dot red. Background color will be red. Color will be white. Now I will give it dot red. Let me see if it is working or not. Link is not defined. Okay. So I will have to do navlink. Instead of doing link. So here I will have to use navlink. So wherever we are using link. Navlink is used wherever we are using link. So I will have to do it manually. By pressing alt key. Navlink. And hopefully I have done it right. But here red class is not coming. Why did this happen? It is active. So I did not return. I have returned. If e.is active. Then we have to return red. Otherwise we have to return empty. Did I spell class name wrong? I have spelt class name wrong. And yes. See. It is done. So these are some patterns. If you click on about, then it will be about red. If you click on home, then it will be home red. So this is a basic usage of reactor outer dom. There are many other things in reactor outer dom. You can go and see their documentation. It will be very detailed. But I will say I have told you 90% in this video. You will not use more than this. And in your basic projects, you will use 100% only. So this feature is very useful. And this package is very good. See the page is not reloading. So that was about reactor outer dom. I hope you liked today's video. If you have not accessed the playlist of sigma, then access it. And if possible, then go to the first video and review it. Thank you so much for watching this video.
