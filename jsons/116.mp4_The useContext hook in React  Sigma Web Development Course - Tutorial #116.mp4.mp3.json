Now let's say we put anything in App.js. We have made many components in it. Component 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Now let's say there is a state in App.js. Listen carefully. Suppose there is a state in App.js and its name is Counter. Now let's say I want to access this counter in component 14. Basically, there are all these components in App.js. Then we made more components which we used in further in components. Basically, we have broken our app into many components. Like navbar, card, side card. Suppose there is a button in the footer. So we used that button component separately. So our app will look something like this. Our app.jsx is the main page. Then there are all these components. Now let's say the counter I have made in app.jsx. I had to use it in component 17. Or suppose in component 15. Or suppose I had to use it in component 11. So I have to do prop drilling. What is the meaning of prop drilling? Prop drilling basically means that I will send counter as prop to component 2. Then if I want to access it in component 8. Then I will send it from component 2 to component 8. If there is a lot of nesting in the app. Suppose there is a component 2 in app.jsx. There is a component 8 in it. Suppose there is another button in component 8. There is another button in mini navbar. So I have to send all these props. It will come from the app here. It will come from here. Then a headache comes. That in so many components I forcefully. I don't even need a counter in component 2. But I am sending component 2 as prop only because. Just because I can reach the nested components inside it. To that state of mine. Is there any easy way? Yes, there is an easy way. How good it would have been if the counter I made in app.jsx. I could have used it directly in component 17 in some way. Or suppose our nesting has gone too far. It could have been used directly in that component. I will show you practically. If you have never understood. But rest assured that I will explain it to you till the end of this video. This is my guarantee to you. So let's start by opening this guarantee and this folder in VS Code. Okay, so I am opening this folder in VS Code. And here I will do the same thing that I have been doing. Which you also know how to do. But I will still show you. npm create read at latest. Then I will put a dot. Then here I will ignore files and continue. Basically it is saying that your files are there. Whether you want to spread it or not. So I am saying that there is no problem. There is no file that will be overwrite. Go ahead and do npm i. And after doing npm i, you just have to do npm run dev. And if you are getting bored, then access the playlist of Sigma. And go to the first video and give a review of Sigma. And my computer is fast. Some people's computers will also run slow. If you have a slow computer. At one time I also had a slow computer. But today I have a fast computer. So this is a basic app that gives us read. Which we have been seeing from the last few videos. You must be knowing that yes, it is fine. Don't click and flaunt. We also know that the counter will increase. But what I want to show you now. That is a component folder. And I will write here component slash navbar.jsx. Okay, with that I will make a button.jsx. Okay, then with button.jsx. I will make a let's say I am making a component1.jsx. And you will say that what did you make with the name component1. But here I will simply write component1. And here by doing rafce. I will write button here by doing rafce. And here by doing rafce. I will write navbar. I will write navbar here. Let's write navbar. There is no need to be so stylish. Now app.jsx is our entry point. Now you have to understand what problem we are trying to solve. Now see what we did here. Let's say we want to put a navbar here. So you say yes, put a navbar. Okay, put a navbar. There is no problem. I have put a navbar. I have also imported the navbar. If you write navbar, it will be automatically imported. Now let's say I want to use a button in the navbar. I want to use the button as per my wish. So here I will use a react fragment. What will I do? I will also use a button here. And here by not using the button. I will say that I have made a component of the button. So why not use that button component. And import that button. Import button. And in that button, I have written button. And it is written that I am a button. And here I have used a span in it. And in this span, component 1. I am using component 1. Something like this. And obviously I will import component 1. Import component 1. Now you will see that our hierarchy is something like this. That we have app.jsx. What is inside that? Inside that we have navbar. Navbar.jsx. Now what is inside navbar.jsx? Button. This is button component. Button.jsx. And what is inside button.jsx? Component1.jsx. Now assume that I will save this file. And here I will write ourapp.md. So that you can understand it. I will keep it here. I have made a file by the name of ourapp.md. You will get it on GitHub whenever you access the source code. So inside the app is navbar. Inside navbar is button. Inside button is component 1. Now assume that this counter. The counter that is running here. I want to send it to component 1. And component 1 displays the value of the counter. That's all it does. Displays the value of the counter. Now this will not work. I will comment this. I will press ctrl z. Let's see if our app is working or not. It is working here. Navbar is here. Then component 1 and I am a button. Suppose instead of component 1 I want the value of count to be displayed. Okay. I hope you understood. Now what we have to do is we have to bring the counter here. To bring the counter here I have to drill the prop like this. I have to pass the count. But who has got this prop? Only navbar has got this prop. Okay. So I have to accept this by destructuring. Either I write props here or I write props.count. I will explain to you in some time. Okay. Either I do this. Props and here I do props.count. Or I can destructure it here by count. Both are same. And you think why both are same. Okay. Either I write count like this or I write props.count. Here I will write props and here I will write props.count. Here I have to write props. Because as props is coming. Props is an object. Props has a count. Here I have taken count from my props object. We have studied destructuring. Okay. So here I got count. I have done it again. Now I have to do the same thing here. I have to take count from here. Or I have to write count is equal to count. In component 1. Okay. Like this. And after this we will do the same thing here. So I will write count here. And now I can show count here. So I write count here. Instead of saying in component 1. I write count. And it will do the right thing. See I am increasing count here. Here also my count is increasing. No surprises there whatsoever. Okay. But was there a need to do so much? You understand. How many components I have crossed to bring count. Then I crossed it in nav bar. Then I put count in button. Then I brought it here. Just to display this count. I have done so much hard work. So this doesn't sound right. Okay. I don't think this is right. This is not right. Okay. So I do one thing. Here just so that you can do comparison later. Just so that you can do comparison later. What I will do. App.jsx and component folder. Here. I will make a copy of it. And here I will make a folder without. And it has nothing to do with react app. Just for you guys. So that you have code. Okay. So I keep that code inside src. What I will do here. I will make a folder. And I will write without. Context. API. Okay. Just so that you have this code. That brother without context API. How was it? So I will change the code. Okay. Now I will use context API. So I say that it was not needed. Okay. This count was not needed. It was not needed to pass as prop. It was not needed to do this. So you will say. So where will this count be found? Will get context API. I am explaining it by taking a little time. But I can assure you. You will understand. Context API. Okay. So here I will remove it. I do not need to give count in navbar. What will I do here? I will make a simple folder. And I will keep its name in context. What do I do with this folder without context? From here. I do control x. And I put it in public. Okay. I am putting it in public. Okay. What is the new folder doing here? I will blow it. What is the new folder doing here? I am putting it in public. You remove it from public. Okay. I do not want you to be confused. And here without context API. So here I had to close the VS code. To move the file. Because the folder was being used. No problem. I open the VS code again. And you just do not see it. I just put it in public. Without context code. Whoever wants to use it, will do it. Now see how to use context API. Components. The way I made the folder. I will make a folder in the same way. I will keep its name in context. And in it, I will make it with the name context.js. Not JSX. I will make it with the name JS. Okay. And you see what I will do here. I will use the context API. So first of all. I will import create context from react. After this, what will I do? I will say const. And let's say I make a context of counter. I will say counter. Counter context. Is equal to. Create context. And I will give its initial value. What will be its initial value? You know its initial value. I want to give zero. And here I will write. Export const counter. Counter context is equal to create context. And I gave zero here. Initial value. Now what I will do. I will use this context. In our app.jsx. So what I will do here. I will come to my app.jsx. And what I will do now. I will use it in my app.jsx. So what I will do here? I will import. This counter context. counter context from context.js and what I will do is I will use this counter context how I will use it? I will write something like this counter context.provider now you will say what have you done? why did you write counter context.provider so basically what happens is if I wrap my entire app in counter context.provider so whatever is inside it inside it and in all its components I will get my context. what does that mean? it means that you remember this syntax that I did it this way basically in context.js we have to import it like this and make a context. that context has to be imported ideally in app.js or you can import it somewhere else basically wherever you import and wrap your app in counter context.provider so inside it and in all its nested components you will get a value. what will that value be? let's say value is equal to count. now count is a state I have passed the state value. remember this so value is equal to count will be found here in navbar, button, component1. there will be a component in it so it will be found. why will it be found? because I have wrapped it in provider. because I have wrapped navbar in provider so it will be applied in navbar. it will be applied in the components inside navbar. now I will directly extract it from component1.jsx now we are not passing prop so I will remove this I will remove this too. here I need value of count I will use use context so I will react from use context actually I should have put comma here and imported so I will import use context I will write const and I will write counter is equal to use context and after this I will write counter context and counter context is imported. so I did const counter is equal to use context counter context and here I will get the value of counter and you see here I did this so I didn't get the value of counter actually my app didn't start. I didn't start the app so I will have to restart the app. now I am saying why didn't I get the value. I am so confident I should get it. see I am getting it. so basically what we did that the count which was available in our app.jsx we used that count in the nested components. we can use it anywhere. so this was our context API. it is a very simple thing now you will say that I want if we click on this button then it will change. this is how use case comes I am telling you this is the experience so count is available in our app but how to change count. so the way you have made count available now make set count available. so instead of putting count as the value you keep an object as value in which you will pass count and set count both. so you said count will be available set count will be available. so the value will be an object ok. so because it will be an object so you call it value why will you call it counter. value.counter sorry value.count not counter and if I want to change it on the click of this button so what I will do. I will do the same thing here and I will get my set count here so I will write here in function value is equal to this and I will on click in this button so the way I have on clicked in this button which changes count. so what we will do. we will use same on click and here on click is equal to set count count count plus one and here our count will be value.set count. or you can do something like this. destructure it. write set count here but let's do value.set count so I have done value.set count and you see I am refreshing it. something is wrong let me see what is wrong let me check. use context is not defined and use context and hopefully app will run see it is changing by clicking on this but now by clicking on this also it is changing so what you can do basically. if you want your state to be available in your nested components and you want your state to be changed then you can do that I hope you understood context API this was the context API in this app I hope you understood. that's all for this video guys if you haven't reviewed sigma codes in first video then do it. thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time music"}
