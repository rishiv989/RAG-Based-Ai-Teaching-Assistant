To understand UseMemo, I will take an example of an extreme case In which I will tell you that if you have an application Which is doing a very intensive task Like suppose you have an array of nums Suppose it has a lot of numbers I will simply say that make a new array And make an array of 30 million entries You can do more, but I think 30 million should be enough for this example After this, I will fill it from zero Dot fill is a method What will it do? It will give you an array with 30 million entries So you will get an array with 30 million entries Now I will do a dot map here I will write underscore comma i here Which gives me the index Dot map has an item and an index here I have done underscore here because I don't want to use the item And what I will do here is return And I will write here, return index i And isMagical, is this number magical or not? Return this that if i is equal to 20 million Or I will say 29 million So if the index value is 29 million Then what will happen? IsMagical will be true here So I am working here simply I have made an array named nums And what I am doing is mapping this array Basically I have made an array of objects In which the index value starts from zero It will go up to 29 9 9 9 9 9 And isMagical will be true only at one place That is, isMagical will be true only at the 29 millionth entry I hope you are getting my point I hope I am able to explain to you what this scene is So now what we will do is We will make a state And what we will do with that state We will say use state snippet And I will tell you why we are doing this We are basically doing this to understand use memo And I will say do it like this Numbers set numbers is equal to nums Now what I will do is I will say that the magical number I will say const magical is equal to And I will say on all numbers What to do? Filter it Or I will say that find that number So there is a dot find method Numbers dot find And what will you do after dot find You will give a function So I will say something like this i And I will say that I don't even need to put I equals to equals to Basically the numbers are the array of objects I will say that I will do item here I will say item dot isMagical Should be equal to what? True It should be equal to true I have done a very simple thing here So what we are doing is If this is true and I don't even need to write it If I write directly, it will work But just to explain to you I am writing it correctly item dot isMagical equals to true So here I have found that magical number And I will say here I will make a span and write Magical numbers and I will explain to you Don't worry I is index Index So here 29 million will come So basically what are we doing and why are we doing I will explain you We have made a very big array In which there are such objects Index will start 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Index will run like this And isMagical will be false in all Except the last one 29 millionth entry What are we doing here We are saying find that number In which isMagical is true So find that number All elements will be checked from 0 29 million Now assume I have changed the count Count is a state What will happen if I change the count My whole component will be re-rendered So this whole component will be re-rendered And when this whole component will be re-rendered So this computation will also work I will comment here And write expensive computation This is a very expensive computation Because we are checking every element And We will get this isMagical true on 29 millionth So this dot find Is very I will say its complexity is very high Its computation complexity is very high So we are doing a very expensive computation Now what will happen We changed the count We clicked on this button, the value of the count was 0 to 1 1 to 2, 2 to 3 We are doing this computation again and again Why are we doing this? Because the whole component is being re-rendered How will we stop? So you should know this So now see What is the condition But still I will reload it And I will show you I have changed the count to 1 See how long it is taking Clicked and now it is happening Clicked and now it is happening I hope my recording didn't stop Because we are doing a very expensive computation Now if I spam it And click on it See See what it will do See what it is doing It stopped from 12 It went to 24 This should be responsive It is not responding See 37, 43 It stopped And if I keep doing this It will crash Because it is very expensive What can we do? Count is changing, component is being re-rendered There is a solution to this problem So I want This expensive computation We can't stop it But why is it happening every time So if you want Some expensive computation Which you want to stop after component is re-rendered Then what will you do? You will use UseMemo So useMemo snippet So what will useMemo take? It will take I am commenting this So I will say Const magical is equal to useMemo I will wrap it like this And I will say this value And I will keep this second empty So I am saying Memoize it Memoize There is a concept of memoization I have read it in the data structure playlist If anyone has seen it, then don't worry UseMemo I am saying memoize this value What does it mean? Just do this computation once and save this value And Save this value in between re-renders Don't do computation again and again Save that value, what was that value? 29 million came out Now I will reload it again Because it was a very dangerous computation I will reload it Did I import useMemo? I have not imported useMemo Okay Let's reload And we will reload it like this I am expecting that my app will run And you see magical number is this Oops Once our computation must have been done And it happened, after that you see How responsive this button has become It means that between re-renders Now that computation is not happening again and again See how responsive the button is See this I am also spamming it like this See I am clicking on it And it is working So when do we use useMemo We have to do it when we want Between re-renders No value is computed again and again Now the second argument of this is Assume for some reason Numbers change Assume numbers change If numbers change Then you want this magical to be computed again Will you want or not? In this case, this is not happening Because chances are numbers have changed Assume we do something here That we change the numbers Because we can change the numbers with set numbers So if we change the numbers Then the simple thing is That our This magical will change Because what do we know what is in our numbers Okay Now this was the default value of the numbers But it is possible that our magical number This time it is only 200 or 500 So we want our magical to be updated When numbers change Otherwise between re-renders Because we are changing the count I don't want this computation to happen again and again This expensive computation I want this magical To be recalculated But only when it is necessary And when will it be necessary to recalculate it It will be necessary when Numbers will change There is no difference in the magical due to the change of the count But due to re-rendering Because of this We have to do this expensive computation again and again Due to which our application is getting inefficient So what does useMemoHook do Memorizes your value If you want To be updated If you want a magical update Then you can say Whenever the numbers change Then I want This is a dependency array You will want that when the numbers change Then only your magical will be updated It is simple If you change it anywhere Then your magical will be updated Every time your magical will not be updated So your application Will be responsive Will not get stuck Like you saw earlier How things were lagging Now you are not seeing that lag Thanks to useMemoHook Now let's say You are doing onclick Set count and count plus one And let's say I am doing one more thing If the value of count I am doing a little bit of cheating Cheating means I am writing a code Which will change the numbers If the count Is equal to 10 Then the numbers Then the numbers Do this I will do set numbers I will do this And this time I will take 10 million And I will do this on 9 million So you see I will reload my application My application got crashed I will reload There is no problem in going from 0 to 1 8 But as soon as my count Value is 10 Then this magical number Will get updated Now see I have done this And my application is running Thanks to dependency array Because of which I was able to tell UseMemo Whenever numbers change Recalculate your magical But please every time Don't do this expensive computation Especially when I am changing the value of count Because count is a state And whenever state changes in react The whole component is re-rendered From here to here This function component Everything is re-rendered You don't want to re-render When it doesn't need to be re-rendered So this kind of expensive computation If you want You can save between re-renders Then use usememo I hope I was able to explain Usememo to you Again, it is not used in basic applications But you should know this And this is a little tricky And you think that I didn't understand this Understand this Whenever state changes in react The whole component is re-rendered And if there is such an expensive computation Then you want it to be Memoized in the next re-render And it will be recalculated When something changes in your dependency array Now obviously You won't put count I am doing this to show you You don't have to do this But if I put count here Then it will be recalculated I will reload it And after reloading it That expensive computation will be done once But this time again our application Has the same condition You are seeing 4, then 10, then 18 See it is skipping What is going on Now it is 9 million 20 million was a little big for it But again we don't want to do this So we obviously don't want to put count If we put count then our application Will be buggy But it is not able to bear 930 million So I hope you understood What is use memo Try it out, you won't be able to do it without trying I guarantee you Send me the paper, I will write it down If you don't do it, you won't be able to put count So if you Don't access this playlist Then do it, bookmark it And go to the first video and put a review How did you like this course If you have seen this video from this course Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time"}
