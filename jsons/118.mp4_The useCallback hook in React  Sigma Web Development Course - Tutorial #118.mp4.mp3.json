Here I write react and javascript and write npm i so that all the packages are installed. And what will I do after this, I will run my server. But before that, I want to show you that it gives a very simple counter application. If you have worked with wheat, you will know. And if you are following the sigma course, then you will know everything. We are doing this in every video. But let's start the server. And npm run dev and we get a very basic counter application. No surprises there. What is the use callback, why should we use it? Let's say I made a component. I will show you by making it. Let's say I made a component in src. So I will make a folder. Component slash, let's say I made navbar. Navbar.jsx rafce and I am a, I will write here, adjective navbar. Okay, here I am saying I am an adjective navbar. And here I am receiving the adjective as a prop. I will import navbar in my app.jsx first. And what will I do after this, I will use navbar here. Now see what I am doing. I will use navbar and I will simply say here, adjective is equal to hey. Or I will put good here. So now see that I am a good navbar has been written here. I am doing this, it doesn't matter. I am a good navbar is written here. Now let's say I want the value of the adjective to be a state. So I will say here, use state snippet. Adjective, set adjective is equal to use state. I give the initial value of it as good. Okay, I gave the initial value of it as good. And along with that, I make another function. And I will write here, change adjective. Okay, this is a very basic function which will change the adjective. Okay, and here it will return. What will it return, let's say it will return another. Okay, let's say it is returning another. Now what I am doing, let's say this function is giving it again. Okay, I am saying get adjective. I will do one thing, I will keep the name get adjective. Get adjective is equal to, I will say here, get adjective is equal to get adjective. So what I am doing, I am bringing this navbar here like this. Now what I will do, I will put a console log here. And I will say here, navbar is rendered. It was very simple, I put a console log. So see, as soon as I am reloading it, I will reload it. Navbar is rendered. It is coming twice because I am in strict mode. I can remove strict mode if I want. If anyone is confusing you, you can remove this strict mode. Just saying, okay. You will remove it, it will come only once. But it comes only in development once. So this problem will not create for you. So I will take the console here and show you. Navbar is rendered twice here. So I do one thing, why not I take it to the side. And how will I do that, I will do it like this. Okay, it came here, now you see carefully. So I am getting to see navbar is rendered here. Navbar is rendered. I will refresh it, I am getting to see navbar is rendered. Now, if I am doing this count as many times as I am doing, I am getting to see navbar is rendered. Because when the state changes, the component renders. So what can you do for that, you can import the memo. You can import memo from react and do this. So what will happen is whenever your props change, then it will render. Now for once I remove this getadjective. Okay, I remove getadjective. As if we are just passing the adjective in our navbar. If I refresh it, then see if I refresh and increase the count, then navbar is rendered only once. Okay, why? Thanks to memo. This is the work of memo. That when the props change, it will be rendered. Otherwise it will not be rendered. Even if your app.jsx is rendering, it will remain like this. It will be stuck until its props change. Because it doesn't need to change. When the props are not changing, then this thing reacts for you. Now let's say I have given getadjective here. And I say getadjective here. Okay, and I will say, let's say I make a button here. I will say take a button here and what am I doing on click? Let's say I am calling getadjective in this way. Okay, let's say I am doing something like this. So here you see that if I refresh it and I do this too, then see it is rendering again and again. Now you will say that the props will change. Why is it rendering? So it is rendering because whenever the whole component is rendered with the app again, then what will happen is that this function will change. Now you will say that it will change, but it is like this. Why will it change? Brother, it is returning another quietly. Why will it change? And if we click on this button here too, I will give some text in this button. Let's say I also give change. I also give change. So if we give any text in this button and click on it, then it should have changed here, but why didn't it change? Because I have done return another. I have not done setadjective, but that's fine. Why don't I do setadjective here? Setadjective another. So if I simply return another, then there is no problem. So if I pass the setadjective here, but I am not doing anything with it now. Let it be simple. The question is that when the function did not change, nothing changed, then why is it rendering here again and again? Is the memo not working? Has the memo been spoiled? No, the memo has not been spoiled. I will tell you what is happening here. What is happening here is that this function getadjective, when the app component is re-rendered, then this function changes itself. If you have written this function in JavaScript, suppose you say getadjective is equal to function. I will show you here. You see carefully. I said getadjective is this and getadjective2 is also this. So if you say getadjective equals to equals to equals to getadjective2, Oops, I did getadjective. If you do getadjective2, then it will give you false. That means if you have written the same function in JavaScript, then it will not be equal. Which means that if our app.jsx is re-rendering, then this function will change. Which means that the navbar will feel that the prop has changed. Which means that it will be re-rendered. How to stop it? Can I freeze it? Can I say something like this from react? That my getadjective function is the same in every re-render. Don't change this, please. So please doesn't work here. Here use callback works. React understands the language of use callback. So you say that I will do use callback. So what will use callback do? You cut this function. And here you write use callback snippet. And what will you do here? Leave the dependency array empty. And here you give this function as it is. So what I did is give this function as it is in use callback. And I have left this dependency array empty. And now you will see when I refresh it. When I am clicking here, then see this is not being re-rendered. Why is this happening? This is happening because this function has been freeze. What does it mean that it has been freeze? Means when this app component is re-rendering, then this function getadjective has been freeze. Means this will not make another function at the time of re-render. Ideally, if you don't use use callback, then getadjective will be made another function. Because the whole component is being re-rendered. Everything will be initialized again. Now when everything will be initialized again, then getadjective will be changed. Which means that navbar will feel that the getadjective prop has been changed. And here memo will feel that a new prop has come. So re-render it. So it will re-render. So what happens here? Use callback freezes your function. So it will freeze your function. Now should we always freeze functions? No, if there is a constant, then you can freeze it. Now assume that I do return another plus count here. I am saying that return another plus count. So this function is changing when the count is changing. Are you understanding? So what should I do here? Here I have done onclick is equal to getadjective. Or if I do not do onclick is equal to and put getadjective here. What is getadjective doing? It is returning value only. If I put it here instead of changeb. Obviously it is javascript so I have to write it like this. So you see that when this component will be rendered for the first time. So what will be getadjective? Another zero. Then what will be another one? Then another two, another three. But if I have used use callback, then it will not be like this. So first of all let's see what happens without use callback. So I do one thing, I do comment out this. And by copying this I show you what happens without use callback. I will write above without use callback. So what will happen without use callback? Understand carefully and this example will explain you. I remove use callback. I am simply making a function here. And I document. So what will happen? When I do this, then another one, another two, three, four. Because function is changing. Navbar is being re-rendered. See here Navbar is being re-rendered. I do it again by refreshing. See Navbar is being re-rendered. And Navbar is being re-rendered. So this is also changing. Function is also. Okay. Actually function is changing. That's why Navbar is being re-rendered. Okay. This prop is its getadjective is a prop in Navbar. So this is changing because of count. That's why what's happening here? That it is being re-rendered. Okay. So if I comment this out and use callback. So what will happen? I am basically saying that when this will be rendered for the first time. So I will say, let this function remain like this. Don't change it on the next re-render. What am I saying? Don't change it on the next re-render. Let this function remain like this. So react will say, let another zero remain. Yes, I will say let another zero remain. React will say, the count is changing, see. I will say yes, let it be. So I basically said this. Computer runs on commands. So as soon as I increase it, neither Navbar will be re-rendered nor this function will change. Because I have frozen this function. Okay. The way you would have seen the video on useMemo. Or you may not have seen. I have made a video on useMemo. The way useMemo memorizes the variable. It memorizes the function. Use callback. Okay. So here if I do something like this. So this is not being updated. Now let's say I want. See, when the count changes, then do it. Don't do it when something else changes. So you will say, okay, something else is not in my app right now. But suppose there are 3-4 more states in my app. Suppose there is a state called count2 in my app. So if I want this. See, don't do it if count2 is changing. But when the count is changing, then please change it. So I will put count in dependency here. So basically I am saying that see, freeze this function. But only freeze it until this count changes. And we can put more values in this. In dependency array. So I am saying that until the count changes. Until then, lock this getExacted function. Freeze it. Okay. I hope you understood. Okay. So with that said, let's check it. And see what is going on now. Yes, it is running. See, the counter is running below and above. Why? Because my count is changing. So this function is also changing. So even after the use callback. My function is changing on every re-render. Because I have said that when the count changes. Then on every re-render. Give a new getExacted. And if I am not using the use callback. Then I am getting a new function every time. Because of which my navbar is being re-rendered. Because I have used memo in it. What does memo say? Memo says that if new props come, then re-render. And if there are old props, then sit quietly. Don't re-render. Okay. So basically this is it. And if I don't use memo. Then whenever this app component will be re-rendered. It will also be re-rendered. Okay. So I hope you understood. Now use callback is not a function. Which you will use as much as use effect or use state. But this is something worth knowing. Especially when you want to make your apps. Very efficient. You are writing such an app. In which you need efficiency. Suppose your function is doing something very compute intensive. Then you will not want. That your component is being re-rendered. Or you are doing something in this component. Which is very compute intensive. You will not want to forcefully re-render your component. So just from the perspective of efficiency. We use use callback. But this is something. Which you will use. When you want to save your application. From being too compute intensive. Okay. So I hope this video helped you. If you have not accessed the course of Sigma. Then do access it. And if you will give me a review in the first video. Go to the first video. Give me 5 stars. And give me a review. How do you like these videos. I will be very happy from the heart. That's all for this video. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Thank you."}
