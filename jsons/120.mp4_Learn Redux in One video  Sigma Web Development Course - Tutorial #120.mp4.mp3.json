about Redux and why we should use Redux you just have to like this video and write Reactop in the comment section it will be shown on the computer screen Let's roll the intro Guys in this video I will teach you Redux in a way that you would have never thought of and before teaching you Redux I want to tell you one thing that we are going to use in this video is Redux Toolkit so what happens with Redux Toolkit things become easy now I will show you a direct application and I will show you directly how to use Redux why we should use Redux I will tell you everything and I believe in learning by doing and project based learning so what I will do here first I will open it in VS Code after opening it in VS Code I will create a React App using Vite and I will use NPM create vite latest and then make it with the name video120 and then use NPM i now why we use Redux I have made a project here using Vite if you are watching this video this whole video is a part of this course but if you are watching this video just to understand Redux why we use Redux first I will tell you when you are using React it means you are making a complex application and what kind of complex application you are making maybe you are making an e-commerce website or you are making a social media website maybe you have thought of an idea and you are making it there are many components in your project so this happens in most of the cases and what I did here that I have installed everything and my app is ready so what you do come here on Redux Toolkit and you search Redux and open it we will use Redux Toolkit because it makes things easy then we will click on get started and click on quick start and here you will see we have to install Redux Toolkit so I will copy it and paste it here and you see here I have simply pasted the command and started Redux Toolkit now I will run npm dev so that my dev server starts and I will click on control and a counter application is created so let's do one thing in the counter application we have used the use state you must be knowing that the app in app.jsx by default the read app is a counter app we will make this counter app with the help of Redux but why I will use Redux it happens that basically if I say one thing about Redux you can read a state if you make a state in simple react then it is only for that component you can't read that state from other components yes you can send like props and then read you can do prop drilling but you can't send like this you can't say that this is my app.jsx suppose I have a component suppose I have made a navbar in components folder and I say that I want this counter in my navbar you can't send like this yes you can do this that my navbar in that I will import send counter as prop we can do this counter is equal to counter counter is equal to counter do like this and accept the counter and in navbar I am a navbar I am a navbar and counter is and I can do counter like this so by doing this your navbar what happened I see I didn't put jsx I actually made it in the name of js I had to make it in the name of jsx so basically what will happen here I will restart this app restart what are you doing wait what is happening I don't understand counter is equal to count there is no counter count is count count is count so you see here I am a navbar and counter is zero and I can send this counter like this I can send my count in my other components but I say that I don't want to do drilling of props and proofs maybe there is another component in navbar and in that there is another component will I keep sending props in every component or not so we use redex in this case like e-commerce website we make cart in that there is a single source of truth redex store what is redex store single source of truth where our state is stored that's it I will not tell you more concepts in this video I believe that you can use at least redex after that all concepts will come to your understanding so I will tell you quickly that without sending count here we can send count in fact we can read it from redex store it should be like this app.jsx component is talking to redex store navbar is also talking to redex store they are not talking to each other you can understand it like this then all the components we will make will not talk to each other and if we update anything in redex store it will be updated directly in our application it is not only necessary that count is there we can put many other states from our app like we are making blog in our app it has a state we are making e-commerce cart it has a state we will remove count from here and we will do it through redex I will show you how we can do it through redex so let's do one thing close navbar and use redex so what we will do we will make a folder named redex in src and first of all we will make a store.js file in redex so what I did is I made a store.js file in redex so you can see here I made a store.js file and I will not do anything I will just copy and paste I am not using typescript so I will just copy and paste so what we did is we configured a store we said make a store we took a store on rent and we will store our states there like you have a store in your house where you put all the stuff that you don't use your mom also scolds you that why are you filling everything in the store so it is a similar store and once we made a store now what we will do we will give access to this store to our app and to give access to our app we will have to import store and provider so what we will do we will come to our main.jsx first we will import store from where we will import store we will not import store from redex tool kit we will import store from store.js so I will do store from and I will write here this is mine in store.js so where is my file I will do one thing here I will write src or I will write redex I will have to see where I have to import so actually if I write ./. then I will write store.js I think I have imported this store properly then I will import provider and from where I will import and see now don't say how did you know that you have to import provider see import provider from react redux provider will give all the app to redux store it will give access to redux store so we have imported store we have made a simple store in redux folder and in main.jsx we have given access to our app that's all we have done that's all we have not done more than this so what I will do is I will wrap it in provider I will say provider store is equal to store and I will close the provider so here in react.strict mode I am wrapping this app in this provider that's all I have done and wherever you are wrapping but if you have decided that you will wrap a particular portion of the app then only that much will be provided by redux store in ideal scenarios we provide our entire app to redux store that's why I have put this in main.jsx so that my app also gets store so we have given provider we have said that you take store and pick whatever you want from store so the entire app from anywhere means from any nested component can read and write store so this is one thing now we will make a slice what is slice? basically slice means that you want to store a particular thing and want to write related function so we will make a slice and here we will copy this file and I will make it in the name of counter slice so here the way they have made counter folder here it's always a good practice that we make a folder so I will make a counter folder and I will say counter slice.js now why I have made a counter folder I want to put everything related to counter in counter slice and maybe I will make a cart so everything related to cart I will put in another folder so this is it. Now what is this code doing this code basically says that initial value of this state is 0 and to change this state these functions can be used one can be used for increment which will take the state and increase the value of state from 1 one can be done for decrement and decrease the value of state from minus to 1 we know that we can't change state like this in react we have to use set state but in redux you can directly use this syntax this is the thing about 100W then increment by amount is one so what we can do here so here state is here action is here and action.payload is here now I will tell you how this is working so we have made these three functions increment, decrement, increment by amount and we will export it like this and we will write equals to counter slice dot actions and we will export by default counter slice dot reducer now you will think what to write no, you have to copy syntax from here, from where I have done simple, syntax now what we will do is inside our store we will tell store that I have made counter slice, configure it so we will initialize what we will initialize we will put reducer inside our store first of all we have to import import counter reducer from where we will do dot slash counter slash counter slice, ok because we have exported by default we have exported by default counter slice dot reducer and we have imported this in store and after this what we will do we will say that we have one reducer and what is reducer so reducer will help us to change the state, ok a function which will take initial state and will help us to return new state now see what we have done we have made slice and added it here now you will think this process was very cumbersome, no it was not, I will tell you again first of all what we have done first of all we have installed react redux after installing what we have done we have provided our store inside main dot jsx after making store, we have made store and then we have provided store to our app ok, we have done this much then we have said that we have to make a counter slice means we have to maintain counter so we have made counter slice ok and because we have made counter slice after making counter slice we have told our store that counter slice is also there we have added it here now from anywhere I can read this counter which has initial value 0 I can read it I can change its value I will change it by using these functions if I want to do something else with this value suppose I want to multiply with 5 then I can make a function called multiply I will show you by making a function called multiply so I will say that multiply is also a function which will make state dot value star is equal to 2 suppose I have said this that what will multiply do and here it will take state, then only it will be able to read state so what I am doing, I am multiplying it with 2 I can do this if I want now I will come to my app.jsx and I will say that I will empty it I will empty my app.jsx I will say that my count what I will do with my count I will delete it and here I will close div and I will do document basically I have put navbar here and what I will do that I will bring the value of count how will I bring the value of count so whenever you want to bring the value of count in your app what you have to do first of all, whatever decrement increment you want to use you will import that function from your slice and use selector and use dispatch you will import from react redux so these two are hooks use selector and use dispatch which we are going to use if you only want to read the value of count then you can read it like this by using use selector, so I will remove this use state this line basically is saying that bring count from our redux store that's all it is saying and display count here which is zero and it will be displayed we haven't done anything big zero is displayed you can see here navbar is not getting the value of count you can ignore it but this zero is showing so I will write here currently count is zero currently count is zero now let's say I want to make two buttons I want to make one button which will plus and I want to make one button which will minus and I want actually plus is later minus is earlier and I want it to increase by clicking on plus and decrease by clicking on minus this is my target so what I will do whenever I click on plus I will dispatch an action which will tell count to increase which will tell store to increase count so I want to tell my store to update the value of count and whatever count it is using be it navbar or any other component update it so what we will do, when we click on plus I will say what is onclick what is onclick I want to change this value, so for that we will use dispatch function, so I will say dispatch increment so as soon as I increment dispatch and to use dispatch I will have to do like this const dispatch is equal to use dispatch which is a hook and obviously I will have to import decrement and increment and I will also do multiply I will also import multiply I hope multiply is defined there, multiply is declared but its value is never read, no problem we will use multiply also so what we did here, that's all and you see here actually the problem here is whenever we give onclick, we have to give an arrow function like this and we give arrow function so that dispatch will not run again and again, so I have to put multiply like this so I didn't put multiply here so after this my app is running and I am clicking on plus, so you see it is getting plus here and I am doing minus, so it is not getting minus but in our navbar this value is not getting displayed so if I want this value to be displayed in navbar so what I will do simply, I will use use selector in my store sorry in my navbar, where is navbar navbar where are you ok here it is ok and what I will do I will take count value from here ok, simple I will take navbar and count value from here and here in prop count will not be there, ok, I am not sending prop I am not sending count as prop as you can see and you see here as I keep on plusing it, you see here count value is being read by navbar if it was a nested component, it would read it, ok, now I want minus to work and to make it work, I have to do a very simple thing that where I was saying increment, there I will say decrement simple, ok, what mistake did I do onclick is equal to this and I will say decrement ok, so I will say decrement here and you see here it started decreasing ok, now if you want to increment by amount, so what you will do, increment by increment by amount will give a value, like I say increment by amount and I say 6 and now if I click on plus, you see it is incrementing by 6, ok and if I say multiply and I will give multiply, let's say I will do one thing I will press ctrl z and let it remain increment and I will make a star I will make a star and I will say multiply and this multiply is the custom function which we made, so you see if I do this, if I click on multiply you see it is doubling, ok, so I will refresh I did 1 from 0 2 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 16 and you see it is multiplying by 2, ok, so this we made custom function, so we do like this, using redux ok, using react redux using redux toolkit, ok so this is it, I will not tell you more than this and I want you to do this and do it yourself and make multiple states make an e-commerce cart using redux, in which you will make a cart to make a cart, you can make a cart folder in a cart folder, you can make a cart slice and in cart slice you can take the initial value of cart and you can make different functions which will manipulate the cart, if you need to pass any function, then you can use action.payload like this and that's about it, that's all about react redux now before going, I want to show you a very nice example of stack overflow and I will put that stack overflow example here in app.jsx in fact I will put it in store, so that you can understand it, I will put it by commenting and you can click on control and open this answer, I want you to open this answer and you will also know that how nicely it is told here, what is store what is reducer and what is action so see what is store, store is what holds all the data of your application, ok, what is reducer which manipulates data and receives an action like increment or decrement and what is action, action is what tells reducer to manipulate the store data, it carries the name and not required some data, like we sent increment by amount as a number which is not always required, we can make increment also, because once we increment so that's why here it is written not required that's all, I never wanted to start any video of redux like this, in which I am explaining you what is store, what is reducer what is action, I wanted to tell you the topic and then tell you what is store what is reducer and what is action, in total what we want to achieve, we want to achieve that we have a store, read write is happening on a single source of truth so that we are supplying a particular value to our whole application and whenever we want to update we are updating there, that's about it if you are liking this course if you are enjoying it, then do go and put review in the first video and give me 5 stars in the comment that how you liked the course thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time Outro Music"}
