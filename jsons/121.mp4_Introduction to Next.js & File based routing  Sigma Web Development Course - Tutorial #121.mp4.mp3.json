What do I mean by big projects? Suppose I want to make a clone of Airbnb or I want to make a clone of OYO or I want to make a clone of any website like Code with Harry or GitHub Then a lot of things are happening in one app Suppose I am making Netflix What are the things going on in Netflix? My authentication is going on in Netflix My content is going on in Netflix I have to keep it in one place and fetch it from there Then I have to ensure what and when should be seen in which component Then I have to ensure that the page is not loaded by using React So all these things become easy through NexJS because NexJS also gives you the functionality to make APIs That is, what you are getting in React is getting But along with that you don't need to use a router because it has file-based routing What is it? I will tell you about it And NexJS has SEO tools Then there are different ways to render data We will read about everything Don't be too confused Now what we will do simply We will install NexJS And to install NexJS you simply have to do npx create next app at the latest This command has to be run And you can make a new NexJS app Okay I will show you how this thing happens So see what we will do here We will open it in VS Code first I opened it in VS Code So I will open the terminal here And I will paste this command here Now see I have pasted this command here Now it will ask me What name do you want to keep for your app? I will keep its name first Because this is my first app Do you want to use TypeScript? I will say no Do you want to use ESLint? I will say yes Do you want to use Tailwind? I will say yes Do you want to use src directory? I will say no Okay Do you want to use app router? I will say yes It is recommended Now I will tell you what are all these things Do you want to customize import alias? No Okay Now move forward with all these options Do what I have done If you are a beginner And your app has started to be made That is, your app is being made in this first folder Okay And as soon as this app is made A lot of files are being generated in it And what do those files do? As we saw We used to make VTAP And by doing npm create vtat latest Similarly, we are making an app for NexJS In which we will write react But there will be some changes for good What is NexJS? I will tell you everything in this video Now see, it has been successful Your next project is made here Now if you have not installed NodeJS If you are watching this video directly For some reason So you must install NodeJS Because everything is happening through NodeJS Npm etc I hope that is obvious So let's close it And now what I will do I will open this first folder So you can do this in two ways Close VS Code Open the first folder Open with code Go to the first folder Shift right click and open with code Otherwise what can you do? I will tell you a command Code minus R and first So code minus R will open here Your first folder Okay So it will open here You see And it is open Now you see what is given here One is the app directory Then we have node modules Then we have public And all these files are made Tailwind has also been given here You are here simply Just like you used to do Npm run dev Do the same Npm run dev And as soon as you do Npm run dev A development server will start for you On localhost 3000 And you see on localhost 3000 You have got an app And this is Next.js by Versal And do the same What we were doing in the VEET app Which was doing in React There are some changes But what are those changes? And why are those changes good? Why are those changes so good? Why are they done? You will also say How easy it is to make an app in this So what will we do first? We will understand the folder structure of Next.js Why are these folders given? You see here What is Next.js There is an app directory in it Next.js can be done in two ways One is through the app directory And one is through pages So whenever you go to the documentation of Next.js You will see using app router And using pages router We will use the app router Because this is the latest Pages router is old Next.js 12 only had pages There was no app router But from Next.js 13 App router has come And we will use app router only Because this is the future So let me tell you this Now see What do we have to do? Suppose I want That I see this page on my slash Which page should I see? Whatever we have here Page.js We will see that So here in page.js If I remove all this And I write dev here And I write dev here And I react it to JavaScript JavaScript react React I have done JSX So that I write dev here So I get it like this I am home page I will do this So I will do I am home page And remove this too In fact, I will remove the whole I will do rafce And I will write dev here And I will write I am home page So I wrote this And you see here I am home page will come Nothing new in that There are some global styles here Because of which you see Black color is visible If you remove it It is completely reset You see here I am home page is written So you should know this thing I will do it again So that our activity is dark mode I wrote I am home page here So I am home page came Now suppose I want That I have an about page on slash about So what I will do Inside the app directory I will make a folder named about I will make a page.js inside it And here I will do rafce What will I do? I will write I am about So I will do I am about here So when I will go to slash about So you see here I am about will come This is our file based routing Means whatever routes you want What do you do? You make a folder for that Suppose I want a contact route So what I will do I will make a contact folder And inside it I will make a file Page.js And I will do rafce I will make its name contact And I will write I am contact Okay Now what I will do Suppose I want to make components So I will make a component here And I will name it I will put navbar.js I will do rafce I will do navbar And I will import this navbar Where? I will import this navbar Here Which is my about page And on my home page Okay, so I can do it like this But I can do one more thing You know what? And that is I can put it in my layout You see here This is the layout In which html is given Body is given And I want Just path of body My navbar Okay So I will import navbar And navbar will come here And you see here Use of add the date I will tell you about it What is it? But I am doing the same Which we used to do in our vtap Means I imported navbar And we used navbar here Okay And you see Now whichever page I will go There I will get to see navbar If I write here contact Then I will get to see navbar Because I have put my whole app Navbar component In my whole app Just like body I have put navbar here Okay I hope you are understanding this thing And I hope this thing Is clear to you Whenever we import Anything in Next.js We use add the date Add the date means The one outside Where our project is Add the date slash component means Go to the component folder In the outermost Go to the add the date slash Public means Go to the public folder So like this You can also do add the date slash app So you can do all these things here Add the date What is import alias basically If you want to do it on the outermost So what will happen with it Dot dot dot slash Dot dot dot slash You don't have to do all that And when you Will get a chance to make big projects In Next.js Then you will know Its importance For now you Think of it like this That we import like this Now if you write import navbar It will be automatically imported So that should not be a problem Okay So what did we understand till now We understood that Next.js is like react But in this we get File based routing Means whatever we want to make API routes or direct routes We make about and contact In this way We can make page.js And as soon as we make page.js In it So whatever we put in it It will come on our slash about Slash contact And if we go only on slash Then this page.js will come So what i do That i come on this page I come on about I am using tailwind here I will write h1 dot Here i will do jsx Okay I will write here h1 dot Text excel Okay And here i will write Like this Problem solved By next.js Okay Now i will go on slash about I will show you By backing Problem solved by next.js And we can write here We can put a ul Okay And we can write li The first thing i want to give Is this This is full stack solution Okay Second thing is This gives file based routing I am telling you the most important features File based routing It gives Then after this With file based routing It gives you Additional features Like next router In fact It is in next navigation I write like router from Next navigation What does it mean We will see in the coming videos But now you understand That we get to see some additional features Like router from next navigation After this we get to see Optimized rendering What does it mean Next.js gives you rendering solutions So if i write here Optimized rendering So you get to see Different types of rendering solutions About which we will discuss In the coming videos But pretty much this is about next.js That it makes things very easy It is a lot of fun to do development And next.js has some features Like Optimized rendering And it becomes easy to make api It is easy to configure middleware If you go in its documentation Everything is written very easily And You will not have any problem in finding Anything Now if you want to change this title Or you want to set its meta description So you can come here in layout In layout.js In which you can change the title Like i want to block it And i want to give its description That i am a blog So what will happen by blocking Where will i see i am a blog I am a blog I will show you Here as meta tag As meta description So in the coming videos we will explore next.js And with that we will see more features Now you guys Access the sigma playlist Because in this I am going to tell you about next.js And if you have not reviewed it yet Then you go to the first video And drop your review In which you will give 5 stars And you will get the free course And for now its enough Thank you so much for watching And i will see you next time Thanks for watching"}
