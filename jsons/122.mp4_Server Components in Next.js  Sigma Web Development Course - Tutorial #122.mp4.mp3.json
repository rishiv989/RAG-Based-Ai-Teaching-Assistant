Set count to count plus one So you can do this And as soon as you do this, I will show you I am refreshing it Why didn't the button come here? I didn't put anything in the button Click me, I put click me And you see here I am clicking on click me So it is increasing So it is increasing So here we have our very basic Client side page But you must be thinking why did I do this in next.js Why do we have to write use client To use state and use effect Now see if I lock some console here Suppose I lock some console here For once we remove this state Remove this state and remove this button too And we can remove this count too I will do one thing, remove this count too Remove this too And what I will do now I will write a console lock here Hey I am Harry Suppose I wrote this So when I am using use client The console lock of Hey I am Harry will come here See Hey I am Harry is coming here But as soon as I remove this Hey I am Harry It will not come here If I remove this use client From top, so what will happen When I remove use client First of all, there is a problem here How did you import use state and use effect When this is a server component So see here Our Hey I am Harry did not come So where is this Hey I am Harry getting locked This Hey I am Harry is getting locked in the server And it is getting locked here in the server See Hey I am Harry The more I access this page The more Hey I am Harry will get locked You are seeing here So this is happening because this page is running on the server side You should know that whenever something is running on the server side It will be locked on the server side console And if something is running on the client It will be locked on the client side Digesting this thing can be a little difficult for you If you do not know the use of this But you understand something like this I can directly authenticate the user here I can do that sensitive work directly Which I want the user to not be able to see For example If I want to read a file Using the FS module of NodeJS I can import FS here And from FS slash promises Suppose I did And if I do here Let A is equal to FS dot Read file And suppose I read the file Suppose I read which file Suppose I read dot git ignore So I can do this So in total I will show you How this thing will be done So I will write here A is equal to await And I can not use await here Because This is a promise, no problem I will use A dot then I will write here E And I will write here console dot log E So I can do something like this And I will show you That the content of this file will be logged You can see that the file is read So I can do here E dot to string And as soon as I do E dot to string You see that the content of this file is logged Can I do this if this was a client component? No, I can not do this If I use Client here, then I can not do this Then what will happen? Then here it is saying You can see Can't resolve FS promises Because now this whole code Where is it running? It is running in the browser And in the browser it did not get this So now understand the difference between server and client Now understand that Whenever we make a component by default It is a server component But as soon as I write here use client All this runs on the client side Next.js is a Full stack framework Means you can write front end And you can write back end If you do not understand this Then you do not worry Because in the coming videos When we have to use server component When we have to use client component We are going to see this Now suppose I have a file here Data.json I will tell you now Suppose I have some data here I do one thing I go to json placeholder I get some sample data So I just get some sample data So that I can copy it This is my json I pasted it here So this json is here Now I can take this json in my use I will do one thing I will remove this array And I will use this json directly I will write Format data Or let's do one thing Let's leave this array Now what we will do We can import this data.json We can read it To read this I have to use it as a server component Otherwise I will get error of FS promises So I will want To make those components as server component Who are using sensitive information Who are taking connection from database Who are authenticating user Means who I want to treat as back end And once here Whatever we are rendering Will go to browser So here the logic you will write Which I have written here That logic After executing You will get to see this HTML in browser Means here you can write back end logic If you have server component But if you have client component You have to be very careful Because whatever you do in client component It will be available here in client side And what to do when You will understand from experience So you understood server component You have to do a very simple thing You have to write client If you want to make any component as client component And you can use it here One more thing you can do Suppose you want to make only navbar And you want to use use state So you can make only navbar component as use client And you can embed it in server component To do this You can make a folder named components Like I can make it on outer side Or in outer most In portion of directory Components slash navbar dot JSX You don't have to do this You can just do jsp And after this We will do rafce And I will write navbar here And I will make it client component So I can write here use client And I can import it here Even if it is not client component So I can say here Import navbar and I can use navbar And I can import navbar Like this Navbar is a client component Page dot JSX is a server component I have used client component in server component And you can do this very easily No tension You will not get any error We need to do this in big projects When we have to take a particular portion of logic And in that use state Use effect Or we have to do that work Which can be done in client component So if you want to do something like this Then you can take out that portion And make it client component It is a simple logic And you will find this very easy When we will see its application And when we will see how components are separated For now if you have not accessed The playlist of sigma Then do access it And do write a review in the comment Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time"}
