Whether it's a link component, script component, image component, let's go to the computer screen and see all these components. Let's roll the intro. So guys, we will start here by creating a new Next.js application. So I will shift right click here and open the terminal first. After opening the terminal, I will write npx create next-app-latest and I am going to name it. I will name it website and I will tell you about different components here. I will enter everything by default and then a folder will be created here with the name of components and websites. And this is our Next.js project, so I will open it in VS Code here. And as soon as all the files will be created, which I will know by looking from here, I will write npm run dev. It's not created yet. As soon as it is created, I will close it and fire npm run dev. And my app will be created. I do one thing, while this app is being created, I go to the app directory and make a file outside. I make a file and I will name it components and slash navbar.js. Okay, navbar.js. After that, I have already built a navbar component here, which I have made and I have written a very simple tailwind in it. I will put it here and I will do the same for footer. So I will make a footer.js here. Footer.js and I have also made a footer component. I have made it to save time. So I will copy and paste the footer component here. Okay, npm run dev. We will run it and our project is ready. Now I will show you localhost 3000. This is how the website looks like. What I will do is I will remove it like this. Sorry, I will not remove the footer. I will remove the main from my page.js in my app. And what I will do is from the layout.js file, I do one thing, I write div here and I write I am home. One thing I want to tell you that if you go to settings, you will go to settings and after that you will search react. And after that, an option comes below that you want to include which languages you want to include in the emet. Now do put this entry. JavaScript here and JavaScript react here. You can put this thing by looking from here. JavaScript, JavaScript react. Write JavaScript here, write JavaScript react here. What will happen with this is that you will get emet in your jsx. Otherwise, emet is not found in js. You will have to react to JavaScript from here. There is a big problem. So that problem will be saved. Now my app looks like this. I want navbar and footer to be visible on all pages in my entire application. And to do this, I will open a special file which is layout.js here. There is an export cons metadata in layout.js which has a title. Assume I am making an app with the name Netflix. So I will say Netflix. In fact, I have made the app with the name of Facebook. I mean, my navbar has Facebook written. So what I will do here, I will write Facebook. And I will write here connect with the word. And here in the description I will write that this is Facebook And we can connect with the word using Facebook. And after doing this, I will put navbar above and below children and footer. And I will import navbar and footer. So I imported navbar and footer. And now my app looks like this. I will do one thing here. I will put my children in a max width container. I can do one more thing. By the way, I do not justify around my navbar. Why should I not justify between? Justifying between will make it like this. And we can do one more thing. If I give gap 2 here, then what will happen is that a little gap will come here between items. But I think our work will not be done here from gap 2. The reason for this is that gap 2 gives between items. I will give mx2, mx4. So what will happen is that I need padding here in x. I will do px2. Padding will be found. And see, my thing is looking like this here. And to put it in a max width container, in my layout, What will I do, I will make it in the name of div.container. And by making it in the name of div.container, I will do mxauto here, which will make everything centered. And along with that, I will screen min height here. What happens by screen min height is that the minimum height becomes 100vh. So here it will look like this. We can either screen min height here or I will make min height 90vh. Like this, so that it looks like mine. In fact, I do 85vh. I am playing trial and error here. So it looks like this. There is no scroll bar either. Great, okay. It's a very good thing. Now it's centered here. Everything looks like a good website. You can also make this text smaller. By the way, just saying. You can also do text access. Come to the footer and put those tailwind classes. Okay. So if you do text access here, it will be small. Text access. Access. Okay. I did text access. And it became small. See, which is typically in footers. Okay. Now see here that if I use anchor tag, Which I have done here. I have used anchor tag in home, about and contact. So what will happen is that my page will be reloaded. Now see here, I will right click and close tabs. See, I am clicking on home, the page is being reloaded. I am clicking on about, the page is being reloaded. I am clicking on contact, the page is being reloaded. I have not made about and contact yet. So I will quickly make about and contact too. First of all, I will make about. By writing rafce, I will write about here. And after this, I will make contact. I will say, Contact slash page dot js rafce. Contact. And after this, I will write here, this is contact. I have not done anything. I have made a folder here, in which page dot js. I have put this inside by doing rafce. And now if I show you. So by clicking on about, the page is going to about. By clicking on contact, the page is going to contact. And but our page is being reloaded. How will it not be reloaded? For that, we will use link component. So what we will do, we will come to our nav bar. And we will say, import link from next slash link. You just write import link. And your auto will be complete. This will suggest you auto. Import link from next link. It will be complete. I mean, what I mean to say is that. You don't get confused by import. If you do this, then you are getting this suggestion. If you do link from next link, then it will be like this. Now what you have to do, wherever you have used a. There, there you will use link. Wherever you have used a, there, there you will use link. So what will happen, that the page will not be reloaded. You see, the page is not being reloaded here. The page is not being reloaded here. By clicking here, the page is not being reloaded. Okay, so this page is not being reloaded at all. Very good. Now what we will do, that we have seen about the link component. Now the best thing about the link component was that the page was not being reloaded. If I go to the documentation of next JS. Okay, I go to the documentation of next JS. And I write link here. So you see here that you can use it in some way. href is equal to here and that's about it. And there are many more props in it. You can do replace is equal to false. And you can read about them. If this is true, then it will replace the current history state. Otherwise it will not. So you see all these minor things. The default of scroll is true. Default behavior of link is to scroll to the top of the new route. If you want to not scroll, stay there. The scroll behavior is maintained. So you can use this. So here if you have true prefetch, then it will prefetch your link. That is, when you click on it, it will already load the data and keep it. Before clicking. So you can see all these things. Now the next thing I want to tell you is the script component. But before that, I tell you that you can change the title on any given page. If you go to layout.js here, then a constant export has been done here. This metadata can be exported on every page. Like if I do it in about, I will put its name about. It's always a good practice that we put its name about. And if I write here about facebook. And I write here this is about facebook. And we can connect with the word using facebook. So now see here when I go to about, then the title will change here. And if I show you about facebook by view page source, then see the meta description has also changed. So you can change the meta description which is used in SEO. And you can also change the title along with it. And let's do this for other pages as well. Like contact. Here I will do contact facebook. And I, this is a page where you can contact facebook. Okay. And what I will do after doing this is that I will refresh it. And you see here home. I am home is written here. About is written here. This is contact is written here. And along with it, you see the titles are changing. See above, the titles are changing. Very good. So in this way you can change the titles on different pages. So I told you about the link tag. I told you about the script tag. I will tell you how to change the title in pages. Now I will tell you about the script tag. Script tag is basically used to inject JavaScript. For example, I want anyone to come to our contact page. He should see welcome to contact page. Assume I want this. I want this. So what will I do? I will import the script. From next script. And what will I do here? I will use the script tag. I will write like this. And here I will write my JavaScript code. I will say alert. Welcome to contact page. Okay. I did this. And I will do this. It doesn't look right. And after doing this, what will we do? That we will click on contact. Why didn't it work? Yes, it worked. Welcome to contact page. Now see. It came on home. It came on about. As soon as I come on contact, welcome to contact page. So if you want to run any JavaScript, on a particular page, then you can run it by using the script tag. Okay. Now if I show you the documentation of the script tag here, then there are some props. There are some props of the script tag. And I tell you about those props. The first prop is SRC, which you can give. And you can use it in some way. In which what will happen is that whatever JS file you will give, it will be executed. Then after this, a strategy prop is very important here. On load, on ready, on error, then you will understand that when it is loaded, it is ready, and when the error comes, then it is run. But let's talk a little about the strategy. There are primarily three. There are four. Three are primarily. First before interactive. Before interactive means that the page you have, before you can interact with it, the script is executed. After this, after interactive, once your page has been hydrated, and you are able to interact with it, after that your script is executed. Lazy on load means that whenever the browser has time, the browser says whenever I have time, then I will load it without any hassle. And I will prioritize other things. For example, if you are loading an ad on any page, then you may want to load it lazy. Because you want that the ad should not come on your page first, but the content should come first, the useful things should be done. The ad will run secondary and you will run it. I hope you understood. So this is our script component. It is very basic and we will use it a lot. Can we use the script in the layout? Yes, we can do it. Like they have done. And whenever you copy and paste the code from the documentation, then do it in JavaScript. If you are not using TypeScript, then do it in JavaScript. And as soon as you do JavaScript, this JavaScript code will show you. And you can use it here. If you want to put any such script, which you want to be in your layout, then you can put it here. Like, let's say you want to run ads, you want to put Google Analytics, then in most of the cases, you will put it in layout.js. And you will put it in the app layout.js. So as soon as you put it here, it will start loading on all your pages. After this, there is one most important component, image component. And to import the image component, you write this, import. As soon as you write the image, it will suggest you below. You import image from next image. And after this, let's say you put any image. Like let's say I put img src is equal to here. Let's take any image. I just need to get an image. Slider image and I just go. I want to get an image that I can use. So I have taken an image from the internet and show you the preview on the homepage. So it looks like this. And we will center it. There is no need to do it here. But okay, do it. Class name is equal to. Now write container, write mx auto. And the center will also be done. This center has not been done yet. But let's see why the center did not happen. If I give bg red 50 in this, then it is coming up to here. I have to center it inside this container. So I did the container. I did mx auto. So I have to give mx auto here in the image. I did this container. I did mx auto in the image. And yes, it is centered. And I can also give from above. If I want to put something here, I can also put it. You can see that there is a little space by putting mx5 here. Now what is the problem in this image? You will say that everything is going well. But I will show you one thing. See if I come to the network. By the way, I am not using the image component yet. This is the image tag which is available in html. Just so that you know. I have imported the image. There is no need to import it yet. I am using the normal one that we used to use. I am using my image tag. When using the image tag, you see that this image will be loaded. I will reload it again. The image that is loading, image slider 3. If you see its size, I will show you by increasing it a little. See its size. I do ctrl shift r so that it is loaded again. Its size is 58.1 kb. Which is very less. But if it was in mb, then we would have had a lot of trouble. So it is 58.1 kb. But do we actually need to load 51.1 kb? Say if we are viewing in such a small device. In such a small device. And I reload. So do we need 58.1 kb? If I do ctrl shift r. Where did it go? Here it is 58.1 kb. We don't need it. If we take this small version of it, then it will work. In Next.js, In Next.js, to solve this problem, an image component is made. Which provides a lot of optimization. And gives us some options. To display our images. I will show you a typical use case. You import the image like this. Okay. Import image from next image. And after doing this, what do you do? We refresh it. And it is written here that image with src is missing width property. So what do I do? I will have to give width in this. So if I write here width is equal to say 100. Suppose I have given width 100 here. And I will also give height. And I will show you one thing. Whenever you put an image here, then you have to give both width and height. So if I do width 100 and height 100. So what will happen? I wrote here width is equal to 100. Height is equal to 100. So its width is 100. Height is 100. This thing that imposing width and height, will make our website optimal. But the image will not work yet. I will show you. And the reason for this is what we have to do? We have to configure the hostname by going inside our next.config.js. So if you go to next.config.js, then you have to configure the hostname of the image. And to do that, I am looking for it here. I write here hostname. Hostname. And what I have to do here is that in our next.config.js, we have to put remote patterns in this way. So I will say remote patterns. I will go to my next.config.js. Basically, I will tell my next.config.js that see this hostname, this hostname, allow it. What am I saying? Allow it. So next.config is equal to I will put images here, and then remote patterns. I will put it like this. So I will enter here in the images, remote patterns. And here www.menucool.com I will put it. Okay. And I will remove this pathname from here. So as soon as I remove the pathname, I will do HTTP to the protocol. Because I am using HTTP here. In case you don't know. And what I will do here, I will come back and you see my image is loading now. So what I did is its width and its height I made it 100. So as soon as I made its width 100, I made its height 100. You can see here that by making width 100 and height 100, it maintained its aspect ratio. And along with that, I show you here that its size, the size of this image is 230 bytes. Can you believe that? Can you believe that? How small its size is? It is 230 bytes. Instead of how much was it? 58 KB I guess. If I am not wrong. Now what I will do here is in my container, I will give size 80. And I will give bgred 50. Or I will give 300. And you will see what I did here. By making size 10, its width and height both get set. Okay. So after doing this, what I will do is I made its width 700. And I made its height 700. So see, it became 700. After that, it maintained its aspect ratio. Okay. And it maintains its aspect ratio by default. Now another property that is in the image component is fill. Suppose I don't give its width and height. And I say fill is equal to true. Now the condition here is that you have to position the container. So I will make the position relative here. And now you will see here that it has filled this container here. If you go to the documentation, it is being told here that by default, the image element will automatically be assigned position absolute style. And in the parent, you have to put relative xd absolute in this position. Now you can play with object fit contain and object fit cover. Like if I contain the object here, I guess object contain is there. If I put object contain in this, then you will see here that what it did, it contained it. If I put object fit here, object fit cover, then I guess this aspect ratio, in fact, the properties I have to put on the image, my bad. If I put object contain here, then see it will contain in it. And it will maintain the aspect ratio. And if I put object cover, then you will see here that it will cover it and maintain the aspect ratio. Okay, so you can do this. After this, there is one more prop, quality, which is from 1 to 100. And it tells you how much you want to optimize, how much you want to reduce the size of the image, how much you want to reduce the size of the image, but the quality will also fall. So how much quality you can afford to drop on which image. After this, there is a priority. If you have true the priority, then what will happen that it will be preloaded. Lazy loading is automatically disabled for images using priority. Okay, so what will happen that image will be preloaded. What does lazy loading mean? As you scroll, similarly your image is loaded. So we are going to use all these things. And when we use image component in our projects, then we will see all these things that how we can use images to stay within a box. Or if we want to contain an image in a box, then what can we do? This is all in CSS. But image component optimizes to a great extent. It is good for us. SEO score helps our website to provide. And we will definitely use this in our projects. I hope you guys understood how to use image component. If you have not accessed the Sigma playlist, then you must access it.
