Tutorial #125.mp4", "start": 794.5, "end": 796.5, "text": " Thank you for watching it"}], "text": " In today's video, I will tell you about the server actions of Next.js You just have to like this video and write Next.js OP in the comment section below Let's go to the computer screen Let's roll the intro So guys, Next.js has server actions And the biggest thing about server actions is that it gives you a feel like PHP Now you will say, what are you saying, what does this feel like PHP mean? I am making a new project here in the name of server actions And here by selecting everything default I will open it in VS code folder And run npm run dev And in the meantime it will be made So basically we have made a new Next.js project And I am making npm run dev to start the server here Assume I have a form, okay Assume I have a form And I want to submit that form And I want to submit something according to this That that data goes to my server So what used to happen before that we had to do this work through API That you make a client side component of use effect Or you make a function by submitting a handle And you give the responsibility to that handle submit function To deliver that data to the server Okay So we can do this thing very simply That we will route our form in page.js through an API And our work will be done But server actions say no See, earlier a lot of work used to happen in PHP And when a lot of work used to happen in PHP So one thing about PHP was appreciated a lot That everything used to be in the same file HTML was also in the same file The work after handling the post request was also in the same file And the next.js server action is trying to That PHP feel But at the same time Bring it while staying in modern JavaScript So I will tell you how you can do this So what I will do here I will make a basic form So I will make a form Action is equal to Now we will leave blank And here I put a div And I will put an input tag inside it And here I simply put a class I say class name is equal to text white And by putting text white I replicate it Suppose I say that this is my name I will label here HTML for is equal to I will say name And here I will say name is equal to name And id is equal to name And I will replicate it The way I made the name In the same way I will make an address By doing add And here I will write address So I am making this in a very basic form in HTML And after this I will make a button And what will happen in that button I will say submit And I will put this button inside div Just so that our form gets styled So you see that I will go to localhost 3000 So my app looks like this It seems that I have not run the server My server has crashed Something is wrong I will run npm run dev And actually I ran it very quickly Npm run dev Maybe my app was not made yet But that should be fine You see here name, address And this submit button is mine It would be great if I Give a class to div I will say class name is equal to And width 2x3 And mx auto And what will happen by doing this It will come a little in the center And I will give a little more my I gave it my And my form came here Which is fine And rest you give it a class I am not going to much on styling I will give it mx 4 So it will make a little distance from it You will do all these things You can also style the button You got the point That I give border border Let's say 2 And I actually I make the border white And by making the border white A border will come here Give padding You can do all that We have done all that Let's talk about the crux of this video I wrote name Oops, I think I have made this text White I should make it black Input I should not make text white Text should be black By default it will be white So it should be black Suppose I write India in the address Now as soon as I click on submit So what happened this page was reloaded See it has done name is equal to harry Add is equal to India Now what can I do Either I do something like this That when this form is submitted Make a handler And then tell that handler E.prevent default I can do all that But nextjs has a new way To do this Nextjs says Action is equal to Make a function I say it is submit action This will be a function Which we are going to make here And we will say Conserver action is equal to Arrow function And what will happen in arrow function Event will be And what will I do here I will write use server Now you will say One minute what are you doing What am I saying I am saying that when this function will run Listen to me carefully When this function will run Then all the work will be in the server So I can access the file system here I can access the database I can do all the work Which is done in the backend I can do everything What will I do for now I will make a file here First of all, I will import fs From fs promises And I will say here fs.writefile And here I make it async function I will say fs.writefile File name is harry.txt And what will I do in this I will write here Hey I am good And after doing this What will I do As soon as I submit I should get my data here And this should be right in the file I work here I do console.log And what will I do here I will say here E.get name And E.get add So basically here I will get this name and address So I will show you If I write here name harry And address 34 So what will happen I will go to network tab I go to network tab As soon as I submit You see a post request You see a post request I will remove this It doesn't mean anything I will write here harry and India And if I submit So see a post request And this post request Went to the same url And if I show you this Backend Then you see here I scroll down I scroll I have done console.log This Which is our E.get name E will be our form data I named E.get And E.get add And I got both of them here How convenient is that And at the same time I do one thing I write let A is equal to Await or console.log A And here you see Harry.txt is also made Hey I am good It came in that All this work we are doing We are doing this on the server side Okay, we are not doing it on the client side We are doing it on the server side If we were doing it on the client side Then we would not have been able to use these promises Alright I hope you understood What will happen if I don't write this user If I don't write user Then I will be shown an error And it is written here Functions cannot be passed directly To client component Unless you expose it By marking it as user So he is saying that it will not work like this You have to do user So that all this is on the server side Or you make it a client component And after that without using the server So all this work will be on the client side But if you want all this work On the server side Then you have to put user here And you see here What can I do inside Harry.txt Instead of writing Hey I am good I can say something like this I can say name is And here I will put dollar and say E.get name And along with that I will say and Then I will say address is And I will say E.get address And I made a mistake here I will fix it quickly And address is And this dollar syntax I will use it again and write add And now you see As soon as I write here Harry And here I will write add Address 45 and submit So you see that my Harry.txt File came in it And address is address 45 Now we can use database You can note this thing here That in this way we Will not write file Why did I show you by writing file So that I can tell you that you can access the backend Whatever you can do in the backend Like we did in Mongoose We can do all those things here I hope that is clear Now what happens is that we have our server actions Organized at one place And for that I make actions slash here Assume I make Form.js I make a file and you can name it Whatever you want and I will remove this action From here I will take it here and I will put it on the user server and I will put all my actions Here So what I did here is that the submit action I took it out And I will obviously put this fs file Here and import here And now what can I do here I remove the image component from here And import Submit action from And from where will I do the submit action At the rate actions Slash form. So I Imported the submit action from here So this is our Submit action But I have not exported it So let's do one thing Let's do export Submit action is equal to in which case You will get the submit action Imported And now if you use it So you can see you can use it So I refresh it, let's say I write here 1212 I submit Here 200 The request is ok and here in the backend You will see 1212 You will see 1212 in the backend And why is it undefined It is undefined because it does not return anything So let's ignore this because we are Writing, not reading So here you can see 1212 came I put my server actions At one place, what can we do We can make different server actions And we can import them on multiple pages Not on one page So this type of server actions are always very helpful And with that Did you notice one thing that when I Submitted this form, this page did not reload And at the same time when I Submitted this form, this form did not clear So to clear this form A very simple way is that I make it a Use client, first I will make it a client Component and if I do not make it a client Component, then what will happen, I want to show you So I import use ref Here and I write here Let ref is equal To use ref, oops Use ref, ok Use ref and I will do something like this Then I will say ref is equal to ref And after doing this What will we do, you see here Our error has come, what is the error You are using use ref in the server And you are using it in the server component Make it a client component Ok, let's make it a client Component and now you see here Ref is equal to ref Action is equal to submit action But let me do one thing Let me create it as an arrow function And Something like this What we will do, we will write e Submit action e And along with that What we will do by putting semicolon We will say ref.current. We saw in the video of use ref That current element is obtained from ref.current And after this I will reset So I said ref.current.reset Means reset the ref.current Means the form Let's see if that works, so I will do harry I will do india, I will submit And you see my form Reset, so I will come back here So you see harry india Is logged on my console And along with that You see here my form is reset So that was about server actions You don't have to make an API You can use server actions To submit your forms Let me know if that was helpful And will you prefer server components Or will you prefer to make APIs And why will you do this, do tell me in the comment section If you have not accessed the sigma course Then do access it, it is a free course And go to the first video and write the review So that other people know That sigma course is actually a meaningful course Go to the first video and tell people How is this course That's it for now guys Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time Thank you for watching it Thank you for watching it"}
