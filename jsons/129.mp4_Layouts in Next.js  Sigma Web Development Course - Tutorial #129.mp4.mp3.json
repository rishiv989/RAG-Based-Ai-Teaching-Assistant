Now this is a mandatory layout, which you will get to see in the layout.js file outside Next.js What I can do in this, whatever I put will be reflected in my overall page structure in all the pages What does that mean? Let's say I make a folder here, I make a file named component-navbar.js And this is my navbar, and similarly I make a component named footer I make a component named footer.js and I will write footer here And I want my navbar and footer to come on both my pages So I will import navbar like this and I will import footer like this And I will simply make navbar here and footer here And I will include this navbar and footer here So what will happen is that you will get to see navbar and footer on all my pages Like you can see navbar, footer, I am home page If I make another page, let's say I make an about page And I write rfce here and I write facebook is And let's say I wrote this random thing and I go to slash about So you will see that here I am getting to see both my navbar and footer So whatever I have to put on all the pages, what I will do is put it in my root layout But sometimes what will happen is that I want to make an admin page Suppose I made an admin section and I want my admin folder to have Let's say login slash page.js and I will write admin login here And I write paragraph here and feel free to log in as an admin And after doing this, I want to have some more pages in my admin Like I want to make a page in my admin, I want to make it in this admin folder So I will say that my logout page is fine I will probably keep the page as logout, but again I will put it in admin So we have login and logout in admin Suppose we have comments in admin I will write comments here and all the comments will be shown to my admin Now suppose I want all the admin pages to have a particular navbar show at the top So what I will do is I will make a layout.js file here Where did I make the layout.js file? In admin And what I will do is I will make a layout.js file here And I will copy it here And I want to show admin-facebook instead of saying title facebook Suppose I want to show something like this And here I want to show the admin page like this So whenever I go to slash admin and log in, suppose I go to admin login So first of all, you see this, I will remove the import of global.css And I will do a few more things with it Which is that I will remove the root layout and I will keep it as admin layout And obviously I will not return html here And I will show an admin bar along with the children So what I will do here is I will write a span and I will write admin-navbar Suppose this is an admin-navbar And now I will refresh it So you see that in all the admin pages you will see admin-navbar And the rest of the navbar was showing us The footer was also showing us So I will do one thing, I will go to tailblocks.cc And I will choose a header from here Because the header here looks a little better to me So I will choose the header here I will also choose the footer here, I will do view code And I will copy it here My footer, I will come here I quickly added tailwind.css here and made something Navbar and footer just so that you get a little feel But if you come here, which we have made for admin So you will see that these navbars are visible here But as soon as I go to the admin-comments So you will see that here I am also getting admin-navbar So if I want something in my layout Which only comes on a particular set of endpoints So I can make a layout.js file like this As you have seen, I made a layout.js file in admin Now suppose I want to group these layouts Now what does it mean to group Now see I have grouped them as admin Suppose I want to change its name to admin-comments And you understand what problem we are solving here I will name it admin-login And I will name it admin-logout Now see what I want to do here If I want to go to admin-login Then I will have to do something like this admin-admin-comments Then I will go to admin-comments If I want to go to admin-login Then I will go to admin-admin-login But if you want If you want to remove this slash admin Then you will have to remove it But if you want to group all the admin endpoints In one folder Then what you can do is You can do something like this You can put it in brackets like this So that you can add a file named layout.js And as you can see I have renamed admin In a parenthesis admin What will happen with this That it will not consider the admin folder But it will put this layout.js file On all the endpoints So if you see here I will refresh admin-admin-login I will run the server once My server was actually closed I needed to restart the VS code Now see here I will refresh it It will give 404 error But if I go directly to slash admin-login Then you see here My admin login page will run But at the same time I have made a folder here And it is called group layouts And in group layouts I can put a file Which will set the title of all the pages As you can see admin is facebook If I go to home then it will be facebook So in this way we can use group layouts And layout.js file You can put it inside In admin comments In admin login and admin logout If I want admin logout To be my layout.js file So what I will do is I will copy the admin layout.js file And here I will say Logout I will do logout navbar So I will do logout navbar And you see here As soon as I do logout navbar I will go to logout Let me see admin logout Endpoint name admin logout So as soon as I go to admin logout You will see that Let me see what's wrong Default export is not a react component Ok So I actually Have not made logout here Now you can see here that admin navbar Logout navbar also came Why did this happen? Because first of all the layout outside Will be applied Then because we have given a layout in admin It will be applied Then we have given a layout inside it Which is given in admin logout So what will happen is It will start populating from here The layout inside the app It will populate it and say ok put html Put footer body and html And what to put in children Then we came to this admin folder We put this layout.js We put this whole thing instead of children Then after that It also has children, so we went inside it Where did we go? In this admin logout folder There we got another layout.js file And here we put all that instead of children So that's why logout navbar will also come And the rest of its children will also come And here you can see Admin navbar came first Then logout navbar came Then our page logout came So this way our nested layouts work And with the help of layout.js file You can change the title of any page So I will write here Logout And I can do it this way You can see here the title of logout is done We can also use a generate metadata function Nextjs So I will show you How can you export this metadata function So in any server component You can do something like this You can say Export async function Generate metadata params And you can generate the title here So let's say if I don't want to make this layout.js file In admin login Then I can say directly here Something like this And I have to do this outermost here And I can put its title here Let's say I want to put its title Login Or I do what it is suggesting me I will do admin login So if I take you here On slash admin login You will get to see That the title here Has been admin login facebook So we can use this function And if I show you here What is params So you see as soon as I reload this page I didn't see anything in place of params But if it was a dynamic route Then I would have seen a lot of things instead of params If it was a dynamic route It is a dynamic value But we get to see params in it But we don't need it now But again we can use this function Write from page.js Because it is a server component So it will render on the server and set its title I hope you understood about the layout How does the layout work Again you will need a lot of practice To understand next.js properly I am saying myself that videos are not going to be enough We will do projects And I have not yet done a project of react Because I want you to stay in next.js And make projects Because next.js is react It is just file based routing and some good features Which make your complex apps easy So if you have not yet accessed the playlist Then do access it Thank you so much guys for watching this video And I will see you next time Outro"}
