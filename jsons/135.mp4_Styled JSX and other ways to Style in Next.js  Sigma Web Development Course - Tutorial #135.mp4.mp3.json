We will talk about it in this video You just like this video and write Next.js op in the comment section below Let's go to the computer screen Let's roll the intro Intro I will create a new Next.js app and open the terminal I will create a project named styles in Next.js I will continue with the defaults Which are my personal defaults And our app is ready I will open this app in VS Code Shift right click, open with code And open page.js and change it a little bit And I will start my development server I will run npm run dev And our website is open You can see here, there is nothing much It is written here, create next app Now you are seeing globals.css Here comes our global styles Which means whatever styles you are going to put here Those styles are going to be used throughout the app And this is because we have imported it in layout.js Layout.js is our building block of all our pages So our HTML tag is in this, body is in this And the rest of the components are in our app folder Or in the component folder outside And because we have imported global.css here This css is applied throughout your app This is really very simple And this is our first way to apply styles So what we will do here Styles slash and I will make a css here Home.module.css I will make the body's background color green And make sure you capitalize the h And here we will import styles from And I will write here styles slash home.module.css And if I put here Class name is equal to styles dot I will write here styles dot And I will write red And I will do one more thing here I will make dot red and I will color it here Red, I have made the color red And here because we are looking at the styling of a specific component So we will add classes here And this class can be used in this way So here the h will come in red color As you can see And these are css modules If you want to write any specific css from this module Then you can make classes here and use them here So this is another way to use Css on a module level Now we will do one thing We will make an about endpoint here And here we will do rafce And here we will write about So now I will show you that if I write here h1 this is about me And after this I write a paragraph Hey I am a good boy And if I go to slash about Then you will see slash about And you see this is about me Hey I am a good boy I have written here Assume I want to increase the font size of h1 How can I increase the font size So here I give class name is equal to container And with that I want to add a css here I can actually do something like this So I will put a style tag here I put a style tag here And after putting the style tag I will write jsx here and this is called style jsx Now what we are going to do in this style jsx That we are going to write our css So here we will write css in this way Now you will see how we use style jsx So what is this style jsx I will tell you a little bit about it But how to use it, let me tell you first Then I will tell you what is it and where does it come from It is built in next js So we will talk about all this But now let's see how to use it So I will say that the container The background color of this The background color of this And I will have to use backtags Because I will have to write in the form of a string And I will write here container And here I will write Background color And I will write red here So I have written background color here I have put a dot container here So here I have put a single backtick And I have put a single backtick here And let's say I want to write here color black So I can also write color black Now you see Here I will refresh it So here it is saying that we have to do a use client Now if you are using style jsx So you will have to make sure that The component of this is a client component So what we will do here We will write use client above And now I will show you And see here the background color is red And here the color is black So I can also make it green It is my choice So here you see its color has become green Okay, I will show you one more thing Assume that I wrap it in a div Assume that I wrap it in a div And inside this div We will make another container And inside this we will write Div.container Div.container And here we will write hey I am good So if I am writing here hey I am good You see that I have In this style jsx I have given some classes to the dot container But you see here it is not applied So the work of style jsx is That you want to localize things a lot You don't want That apart from this element Things go out somewhere So for this we use style jsx Now style jsx is a library I will show you Style jsx if you write here So you will see The style jsx is Built in next js Now style jsx is a CSS in js library Which is made by versal And in next js they give it built in So it is not like react You can use it But it is built in next js And at the same time It is a css in js library Now here you can make style jsx Global, if I make style jsx Global here Suppose I write global here So what will happen by writing global I refresh it, now see by doing global The styles written in it They will be applied on the whole page Will be applied on the whole page So you should understand this thing So this was If you want to do a particular Component level styling In a particular page You want to do a small element styling You can use style jsx And style jsx is a good way If you want to fix something Which is breaking your particular component And as a developer Your app is irritating you Why this red is not happening Why all the other reds are happening You are not able to do any work easily Some css is coming through a library You have to overwrite Use style jsx Now I will talk about what I personally use And here we will talk about personal preferences I personally use tailwind css It solves all my problems related to css It solves all my problems related to css Whenever I want to put global styles I come here And put global.css And here I put I use those classes if they are so global for me And if things are localized So what I do is I use tailwind css utility classes I use this personally I used style jsx in a project And it helped me a lot Because a css was coming through a library Which was irritating me a lot And I remember that we made things very easy With style jsx Style jsx and style jsx global We used both of them And it is very helpful You should know this is a global thing If you don't put global It will apply where you have written style jsx If you don't put global It will apply on the whole page I hope you got to learn something new about styling That's all for now Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time"}
