How you will deploy that app, I am going to tell you in this video. We learn how we can deploy our Next.js apps to Vercel. I am very excited about this. And if any of your project is ready, you will also be very excited to deploy your app in Vercel. Like this video and write Next.js OP in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, before we talk about how to deploy in Vercel, I want to show you something. I have made this app very different. And as I told you in my previous videos, you can make Bitlinks in this way. We made an app with Bitlinks, if you don't know. Now I will tell you here what changes I have made in it. I have made it responsive. I have added some design elements along with making it responsive. I have put some typejs here, which is easy. And here you can shorten any URL. And your short link will be generated. Let's say I want to shorten my YouTube channel here. I do create short link. This is my short link. So you can see here that I can go on it anytime. And see, I have been redirected. So I can do something like this. And here I have given my .env.example. So that it can be copied and made .env.local. How to deploy it on Vercel? Let's see. So first of all, we will log in on Vercel. Now if you don't have a Vercel account, then you will have to sign up first. And here I will say that I am working on personal projects. I will put my name here. And with that I will continue. And then I will continue with GitHub. And here I am already logged in. You can get it logged in. It is saying what is your primary goal. You may want to do learning. What type of projects you are building. You can say that I will do other. And I will do it for beginners. Because if you want to learn Vercel, then you will have to make it a beginner. And we will continue. And let's see what happens. Now you see here, let's build something. Now it is saying that you import a git repository so that you can host it. To do this, I will have to push it on GitHub. Now how do I do that? Now this is not a GitHub repo, so I will initialize it. I will put an initial commit in it. I will put a commit and then I will push it on GitHub. I will do a private repo. And here it is showing publish to GitHub. Now if you can see here, it is telling me. Successfully published the code with any slash bitlinks to GitHub. Let's see if it has published it on GitHub. Yes, it has published it. Okay, that's good. Now what I will do is, I will add my GitHub account to my new project. Obviously, I will install my GitHub account here. And then you see here, it has recognized all my repositories. I will import it. Now I said, import from here. Choose where you want to create the project and give it a name. So I will put it in the Haris Projects Vercel team. So basically what happens is, Vercel makes a team for you. You can manage multiple teams. Now by default, a team is created by doing Haris Projects. We will keep it by default like this. It has automatically detected the framework, Next.js. And now you see here, what will be the root directory, .slash. It means that my project is lying here. It also detected this. Now here is the build and output settings. It has automatically detected the build command. It has also detected the output directory. Because it automatically detects it in Next.js. Now we will have to put some environment variables here. So what will we put in the environment variables? First, we will have to put NextPublicHost. Which I will put in a while. For now, I will deploy it. And I wait. Now it is showing me all the progress here. Let it be complete and then I will come back. Now I got an error here, add Mongo URI. Because I have to add a Mongo URI. So what I did, I will copy and paste my .env.local. For now, I will put this Mongo URI. And I will also put my NextPublicHost. But we will change it later. So for now, I will put this Mongo URI. And also I will put my NextPublicHost. And then we will change it. So for now, I will copy and paste it. And I will remove this slash. And deploy. I am deploying it again. Now here it is saying, Congratulations, you just deployed a new project to Harry's Projects. Now you can see here, that by doing bitlinks1.versal.app, it is running here. And it is running very well. Now it is saying, Share to invite anyone to collaborate on this page. Now I will skip it. Now I will continue to dashboard here. And this is my production deployment. And I will show you here, how you can redeploy in this and change the environment variables. So the first environment variable that I want to change, is my domain name, which is versal.app. I want to use NextPublicHost. So I will go to domains here. Here I will go to environment variables. And let's change the environment variables here. So what we will do here, that we have our MongoDB URI as an environment variable. And along with that, we have our NextPublicHost as an environment variable. So we will add it. So here I will add NextPublicHost. So here I will simply add the value. And here I will paste the NextPublicHost here and save it. And now we have two environment variables here. I will edit it to Mongo URI. I don't want it to be MongoDB localhost 27017. Rather, I will go to my MongoDB Atlas account. And I will copy it from here. So that my app can run properly. So I will copy it from my MongoDB Atlas. And I will paste this connection string here. Let me do one thing. I will click on database access here. And I want to create a user. So if I give a new password to this user, and I say here that give this password. This is its password. I have created a user named Harry123. And what I will do here is update it to user. So I have updated the user. I will also update my password. And what I will do here is, I will put the username where the DB username is. Which is Harry123. And I will put my DB password here. Which I will not tell you. So I have updated and clicked on save. And now I will redeploy this app. Now it is saying that a new deployment is required for your changes to take effect. Obviously. Come on, let's redeploy. And I will show you how you can redeploy. And you will go to deployments. Then you will click on three dots here. Click on redeploy. And I don't want to use existing build cache. I want to redeploy it directly in production. And it will take some time to deploy. And then we will see if Bitlinks is accessible or not. And Bitlinks is on this URL. So I will do one thing, I will open it in the guest window. Now I made a mistake here. I put a slash here. I removed the slash and saved it. I will redeploy again. I will go to deployments. And here I will click redeploy. And I will redeploy it. We can use existing build cache. Okay, I will redeploy. Now this redeploy has been done. So what I will do here. I will try this in the guest window. So let's say I want to short the link of my Tailwind CSS playlist. And I want to click on shorten. I want this URL to be bitlinks1.versal.app. Slash tailwind. So I will click on generate short link. It will take some time because I am using the free version of MongoDB. URL generated successfully. Okay. And look here, I will go to this link. So here it will redirect me to this playlist. So here double slash is coming because I put a slash in the next public host. But it will be fine. I have just redeployed my app. So bitlinks1.versal.app. Go check it out. So now what I will do here. I will tell you how you can use custom domain. You can use any service. I am using Hostinger. You can use any. There is nothing. Wherever you find cheap, buy a domain from there. I will click on get a new domain here. I will write bitlinks and I will see if I find it cheap. I am looking for bitlinks.in. Bitlinks.in is already registered. Now what is here is that I have got bitlinks.online. It is a very nice domain. Bitlinks is also its name. So let's buy it now. I want to buy it for just one year. And I see here that I had an open code with harry. It seems or not. See, brother, the cheaper you can buy, the cheaper you buy. What is the problem? No matter, I will pay 270 rupees. I will click on complete payment and I will pay 270 rupees. It will be fun. So I will pay 270 rupees from UPI. So brother, I have completed the payment here. And now my work should be done. And my work is done here. You can see that I am redirecting to hostinger.com. I will show you how to use this domain with Vercel. And here I am being given great news. It is being said that you have bought bitlinks.online. Congratulations to you. So now I will go to my domain portfolio. I will go to bitlinks.online. I will click on manage. And then I will go to DNS name servers. And here I will click on change name servers. I will do change name servers. And I will show you what you will do now in your Vercel. So you go to your project of Vercel. You go to domains in it. After going to domains, you are here. Bitlinks.online. It is online. Bitlinks.online. You put your domain. After putting that domain, you click on add. And then it is saying www.bitlinks.online. And redirect bitlinks.online to it. So I will click on add. And after doing this, it is saying that the configuration is invalid. So what we will do is we will put these two name servers of Vercel here. I will show you how to do this work. You have to put these two like this. You have to click on NS1 and NS2 and save. And after this it is saying that it may take 24 hours. But in my case, it usually takes a lot of time. So it's fine. Now what we will do here is we will come back to the same page. Now let's refresh here. It takes a little time. So we will have to give it time. And once we have given it time, then this bitlinks.online and www.bitlinks.online will work on our app. And then you know what we can do? We can open www.bitlinks.online. I will show you. And this bitlinks.online, we can put it in our environment variable. So I will show you here. We will come to the project. After coming to the project, what we will do is we will come to the settings. Where is its settings? Here are the settings of our environment variables. Here are the environment variables. We will edit it. We will put this and this in the next public host. And we will not keep the slash. We will click on save. And after that we will also redeploy. And now what we will do here is we will wait for our domain to be added. So let's wait for domain configuration to happen. And as soon as this happens, then after that we will start our work. Now as long as our name server is being pointed, I want to give you a little bit of hosting knowledge. So see, if you ever want to make a blog in your life, then I strongly recommend that you use Elementor's hosting because you get Elementor Pro. If you are not using WordPress, means if you want to make a blog, then I recommend WordPress. If you are not using WordPress, then yes, you can go to VPS. But if you are using WordPress, I will say choose Elementor's hosting. And the paid plan of Elementor, which is available for free, there are many things in your dashboard. If you are making a website just for blogging, then use WordPress. Don't custom build it. This is my advice to you because you want to focus on content. After this, if you want to get VPS for free, then Digital Ocean, Linode, Walter, even you get plans of AWS, which you can get by putting a credit card for free. Now many people will say, money can be deducted from my credit card. So see, this is the thing, money can be deducted from your credit card. But if you play smartly, then money will not be deducted from your credit card. You go to your bank's app, turn on the online payments of the credit card, subscribe and then turn it off. See, I have no benefit in this. I am just teaching you things from my experience. And after that, once you have closed online payments on your credit card, no one can take the payment from you. Money cannot be deducted from your card. It is not possible. And whenever you want to use it, then turn it on. Nowadays, a basic credit card is very easily issued. A basic credit card with a limit of 10,000 is issued. If you don't have it, then you can take someone's help. Take a credit card and go to different hosting providers and you can get VPS. Now this is not sustainable for the long term if you are making a business. But if you are a learner and want VPS for free, then you can use it. Whenever you sign up for a new digital audition in Linode, you get free credits. Use those credits. And make your goal that you earn enough money that you can afford these services. Even after giving their money, you have a lot of profit. This should be your goal. Use the free hosting of Varsel if you are a student. And after that, you earn so much money by making websites. You can host it by giving money to your hobby project. Another option is Tremendous. And what is tremendous, it basically issues a credit card to you. I will show you here. Tremendous card. Okay, tremendous card is gift card and rewards. So what does it do? It issues a virtual credit card to you. So it gives you a virtual Visa credit card. It takes some money. You can issue a $5 card from here. And you get a full card. So what happens is that you don't have any liability. If you issue such a virtual card, you can search on the net. Virtual credit card. Now, like you bought a $50 virtual credit card, then you have a $50 liability. You don't have more than that. Again, I am telling you all these things from experience. I tell you a lot of things in videos. They change. So you have to check yourself. You have to spend your money after that. Everything is in terms and conditions. Look, I am just giving you advice. Okay. I am just giving you advice. If you have a lot of load on your website, which is good because you will be able to earn money from that. So you will have to take paid hosting. You will have to stick to one service. And you will have to pay its bills. Which is good. Which is a good news. Because there is a lot of traffic on your website. So it means that you are earning money. And if you are earning money, then this is the goal. This is what you want. So yes. It's a very good thing for you guys. If this happens to you guys. Now luckily I tried the other method. Which was to set the DNS record. So that did my job. So I will also recommend you this. That you use the name server hosting. And here A record. And edit this CNAME record. So I did this. So you see here. This is my work done. Generating this SSL certificate. And after this, my app will run. I hope. So come on, let's see. This is my bitlinks.online. Is it running or not? So wow. My bitlinks.online is running. Although it will take me some time to get SSL certificate. But again I am very happy. That it is running at least. It is showing the sign of not secure. Because I don't have SSL certificate yet. But again that is how you host your website. And let's wait for SSL certificate. I think I have got it. Bitlinks.online. SSL certificate. I wait a little more. And this generating SSL certificate will also end. And after that my work will be done. Now as you can see here. That I have got SSL certificate on bitlinks.online. Which means I will redirect it. So now I will be able to go on HTTPS connection. Hopefully. So I do one thing. Here I open it www.bitlinks.online. I open it like this. It is showing not secure. I open it in guest mode. I open it in guest mode. Now it is saying. Doesn't support a secure connection. I think it will take some time. To get SSL. And I have got SSL. Connection is secure. Nice. Let's try to shorten my sanity IO tutorials. And let's name it sanity. Create short link. I clicked on it. Now see the free mongodb is a little slow. And here still the environment variables. I think it has not been updated. No problem. What we will do is. We will put this bitlinks.online. To the next public host. Come on. Let's do it. And finally we will wrap this video. If I go to environment variables. Then my next public host. That is bitlinks.online. I think I have not redeployed yet. I need to redeploy. Now this 23 minutes ago. We redeployed. Let's redeploy it again. Alright. Let's redeploy. And see if our work is done or not. So here our deployment is successful. I do one thing. That our github. github.com slash code with harry. I will shorten it. And I will put its name. This is my URL. I will put its name as hg. Harry's github. So I will click on generate short URL. And then I will click on ok. And see here. Bitlinks.online. Go make your bitlink. Go make your bitlink. And use it. Now whenever you want to short the URL. You will use bitlinks. Promise me in the comment. Because we made this project with heart. We put our life in this. You all also learned. You know how it works. You have a good reason to use it. I think that was a very good marketing. Which I did. But anyways I know you will use it. And see here it is responsive. One more good reason to use it. It is responsive. What else do you want in life? Do you want anything else in life? See this is responsive. So promise me in the comment section. And with that we will wrap up this video. I hope I gave you the knowledge. You enjoyed it. That's it for now. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Outro Music."}
