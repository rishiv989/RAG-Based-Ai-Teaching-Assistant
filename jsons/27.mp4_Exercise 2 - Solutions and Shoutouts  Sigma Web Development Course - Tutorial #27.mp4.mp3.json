In today's video, I am going to give you the solution of exercise 2. Like this video with high energy because everything will be out and found in this video. I am really very excited. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys who will be the next episode of shoutout party, we are going to see the solution of exercise number 2. And let's see who has solved exercise number 2. And let me tell you guys that many people have solved exercise 2. And I will scroll down to see all your solutions. And after that, as soon as I scroll down, I will come back to the bottom. So first of all, this was video number 20. By the way, someone suggested me that you should rename this video 20 as tutorial 20 and make it 01. So I might do that. So if you get video 01 instead of video 1, then don't be surprised. So I will rename it. In fact, I did it. You guys can see. Now I will go to video 20 and see what it was. Because I have forgotten it a little bit. And I had written in the comment that what is the question. So if we see the question here, in fact, I will open it in VS code. I will open video 20 with code and I will copy it by doing open with code. And then after that, this is our video number 27. So I will make a folder here in the name of video 27. New folder video 27 and I will open a new VS code instance in video 27. And here I will make an index.html and put this thing in it. So let's talk about what was the question. So the question is, write an HTML and CSS code to style a paragraph inside a div which contains 5 other paragraphs. So here is a div and inside the div you have 5 more paragraphs. And here you can see that the first paragraph must have a background color yellow and text color red. So this is the first paragraph that you have given the condition for it. And the rest of the paragraphs have a background color blue and text color white. So to solve this problem, what I will do first is that I will put the background color blue in all my paragraphs. As it was said, by the way, I hit the control enter if you don't know. Suppose your cursor is here and you want to bring it in a new line. I will keep telling you these things. Hit the control enter, it will come straight down here. If your cursor is here, hit the control enter, it will come straight down. And here you can see that its background color is blue and text color is white. So all the paragraphs will have a background color blue and text color white. There are no surprises here. I open it in the live server. Click here and open in browser. Or let it stay here for now. We have to see the color. Then after this, what will I do? I will say that the paragraph inside the paragraph is inside the div. I will say that if it is the first child, then what should I do? Then make the background color red. Yellow and text color red. So the first paragraph will be like this. And all the other paragraphs will be the same as we have styled. So this was very simple. People have also used the nth child pseudo selector. In the nth child, if the first child is the first child, then such a property will be applied to the paragraph. In the nth child, suppose you make it 2. So if the P is the second child, then it will be applied. Suppose I do it and show you. Because we have come here to learn CSS. If I make nth child 2 and put it here, then you see the property will be applied to the second child. See, this means that this property is applied to P when it is the second child of your parent. This is what it means. So I hope you understood this thing. But I will delete it because I want to give you a solution. So here CSS HTML code to style a paragraph inside a div which contains 5 other paragraphs. Now there are 5 other paragraphs in it or 10 other paragraphs or 20 other paragraphs. The first paragraph has to be made yellow and text red. Which has already happened. Background color yellow and text color red. And the background color of the rest of the paragraphs is blue and text color white. As you can see. The HTML is written below for your reference. Do not change this HTML. It's not that you put inline slices. That's why I wrote this thing. Do not change this HTML. So let's go. Let's give a shout out. In the next episode, let's go. Who will be the shout out husband? And here he has written without hashtag. Muhammad Hassan and a big shout out to him. I would like to see his CSS. He did exactly what I did. By doing Dev P, he has made the background color blue and white. Like I have done. Background color blue, color white P. And in fact, I have printed it all. Not him, I have printed it. I have actually not done cheating. Guys, listen to me. Okay, don't think that I have cheated their solution. Not done. Exactly our solution is the same. Big shout out to Muhammad Hassan. Then Dev Dutt Paul. Let's see his solution. And here you can see that he has P first child. Dev first child P first child. There was no need to do Dev first child. Because what is here is that if Dev is the first child of his parent. Which I did not make sense of. In fact, if I put their CSS here, then it will not work. Okay, I'll show you. I'll show you. I comment out my CSS. And I put their CSS here. And you see their CSS is not even working. Okay, so here we said that inside a div which contains five other paragraphs. The first paragraph must have background color yellow. Okay, so see the color of the one below has gone bad. So their solution is wrong. But I liked their intent to learn. And a big shout out to them. Dev Dutt Paul. You see what was wrong in your question. Then after this Rohit Jagtap. 547. What did he do? He put a class. And you did not do well by putting a class. Because you did HTML change. Brother, I had written this in the question. That you can't change HTML. But a big shout out to Rohit Jagtap. And you see your mistake. And in the coming questions, exercise. Get up like a new player. Okay. After this, he has used P first child here. And he did exactly what he did here. Big shout out to Suraj Biswas. Then a big shout out to Devendra Chauhan. That he accepted the challenge. And here you can see that he put an ID. MD Huzaif. MD Huzaif, why did you put an ID? What, you put inline style? If you had to put it. Okay, but no problem. MD Huzaif will understand what I said. And we will implement it. I hope that he will come up in the exercise like a better player. Okay, so he will come back very soon. I know. And let's see what is happening here. Here he has also targeted exactly by putting not first child. Yes, this will also work. You can also target by putting not first child. In fact, their CSS will also work. And we can actually check it. If they have not done anything wrong in the syntax. Then it is going on. But as I told you. That you do one thing in all paragraphs. And the rest is done in this way. So big shoutout to them. And after this I give shoutout to other people. Who have given the solution. Onkar, Javkar, Shubham. And shoutout to Sukesh. Shoutout to Without Me. MD, shoutout to Aarey Hussain. Shoutout to Arshad. Shoutout to Hashir. Shoutout to Shrest. Shoutout to Tauseef. Shoutout to Preetam. Shoutout to Nitesh. Shoutout to Mohit. Shoutout to Aarey. Shoutout to Rhea. Shoutout to Vikas Gupta. Shoutout to Pathan. Shoutout to Bhaktawar. I have given shoutout to everyone from the bottom. Now I will give some random shoutouts. And I want to give random shoutouts to user. I want to give shoutout to user again. User is coming from so far. I want to give shoutout to study. I want to give shoutout to Aribul Haq. Then I want to give shoutout to Thor. I am not giving shoutout to user. I am giving shoutout to Prince. User. Shoutout to user too. Shoutout to Samadhan Patil. Shoutout to Umar. Shoutout to Ranjeet. Shoutout to Hustler. Shoutout to Sai Chand. And I hope you liked it. This was our exercise. After this I will scroll. So that everyone's name is at least. If I am not giving shoutout. Then it will splash on the screen. I know many people will get dizzy by seeing this. But you see this. You see this. By the way, if you don't know. If you press the middle mouse wheel. And press your mouse up. Then it scrolls like this. And it is very useful during recording. When I record a video. I want to use it during editing. But I went out of context a little. If you have not accessed this playlist yet. Then do access it. Along with that. I am updating the source code on GitHub. Sometimes I get half an hour late. Sometimes I forget. If it happens very rarely. That I got late one day. To put the source code. Then you don't worry about it at all. You will get it. By the way, I put this pull request. Someone put it. I liked this description very much. If you want to make it better. You can put a pull request. But I will say don't focus on this. Focus now. Learn web development. In the Sigma web development course. Our first focus is. Learn web development. So you focus on that. So I hope you guys are having fun here. You must be feeling good. Doing this course. How is it looking? I want you to go to this course. And in this course. Comment in the first video. Tell me how is this course? Go here and give me 5 stars. For those people. Who are going to start this course. So I just put the source code here. By pushing. And here. You will get all their names updated. I have actually changed this name. So that it goes from top to bottom. And it has come in the series. It was actually a good idea. Whoever gave me. Big shout out to them. I hope you guys are having fun. In this course. Thank you so much guys. For watching this video. And I will see you. Next time. Thank you."}
