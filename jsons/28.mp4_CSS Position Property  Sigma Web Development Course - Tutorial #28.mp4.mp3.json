Suppose you want to move an element from its previous position, then you can use position relative to create a top 3 pixel and that 3 pixel will come down. Similarly, by using position property and z-index, you can keep the elements on top of each other. How all these things are done in CSS? In this video, we are going to understand. Do write Sigma Batch O in the comment section below. And keep this high energy. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. In CSS, position property is very important. So I will make a folder named video28 and show you. Let's name it video28. And after that you will know how important position property is and what can happen with it. So as always, I will make a boilerplate template. And after making a boilerplate template, I will simply write CSS position here. I will put a style tag here so that I can style the elements. And I will put 3 boxes here. I put 4. Box1, I gave one class, I will give one box2 class, I will give one box3 class, I will give one box4 class. And I will give one box class to all of them. So that if I want to do something with all the boxes, I can do it by dot box. So here I will simply say dot box, border, border, 2px solid black. And I reset CSS by putting margin 0, padding 0 on the universal selector. You must know this, if you know me a little bit. This is my habit that I select the universal selector and put margin 0, padding 0. So if I see this now, I didn't see it and I want to know the reason for this. The reason for this is that we have not given height and width to each box. So let's give it a height and width of 133 pixels. And let's give it a width too. And I am going to give it a width of 80vw. Now that we know how our sizing units work. Along with that, I would like to give padding to all the boxes. And I will give padding 3 pixels from all sides. And I will also give margin 3 pixels from all sides. So what will happen with this, the boxes will look something like this. Now I will be able to target box 1, box 2, box 3, box 4 individually. But let's do one thing, first of all, I will get you access to a playlist. Or click and ask for a book or click and save, which you will do right now. And along with that, I want you to open it in the browser. So as you saw here, our browser has prepared all our boxes by doing margin, padding and everything. If you want, you can also write box 1, box 2 here. But I think that's fine. Let's leave it like this for now. Now what I will do is I will write dot box 1 here. And I will add some CSS to it. And I will say this work for box 2, box 3, box 4. I will put the background color in box 1 with the letter. Similarly, we will put a background color in box 2, any random. And the background color of box 3, we put this with the letter. And I will make the background color purple. So you saw here, we got 4 boxes like this. Now what is by default, the position of all the boxes is static. Position is a property in CSS, which is by default static. And the meaning of static position is that top, bottom, left, right, z-index cannot be written on it. Now you will say what is top, bottom, left, right? Now if I put top 2 pixels on it, then Chrome is telling me that Position static property prevents top from having an effect. If you keep any position other than static, then you can enjoy this property. So how to enjoy this property, this is what I want to tell you now. So see, if I do not use position property in it, That is, its by default position is static, then what will be the behavior? First the top box will come, then this box will come, then this box will come, The bottom box will come, and then the last box will come. Typical CSS behavior that I will expect. Let us say that I put the absolute position of the bottom box. So you understood the meaning of position static. Position static means that it will remain where it was, it will not have any effect. Now after this, there is an absolute position, there is a relative. Before absolute, I will tell you what relative positioning is. Now assume that I say to box 2, put its position relative. What should I do? Relative. Relative does not mean relative here, relative means that I can move it from its place and now I can put top bottom properties in it. If I say top 3 pixels, the more I increase, the more it will go down. You see, it came above it. The more I increase, the more it will go down. The rest of the elements will not matter, I can move this element from its place. So if I want it to go up a little and if I want it to go a little to the left, I say left 34 pixels, then the distance from the left to here will be 34 pixels. And I will increase it as much as I want. So what happened is that it got stacked on this box. Our CN box is stacked on it. Its color is not CN, I guess its color is Aqua. So it came on the Aqua box. Now assume for some reason you want my Aqua box should not be down, my Aqua box should come up, this box should come behind it. So we can set the value of Z-index. If I set the value of Z-index here, let's say, it will not make any difference. So what I have to do is put position relative in it, then Z-index will work. I will come to this later why we have put position relative here. But as soon as I give it position relative, I can set its Z-index. If I give it 1, it should not be 0, it should be 1. If it has more than this, then it will come up. Now we have put position relative because whenever you want to use Z-index, then you have to remove the position property and give some position. This is the rule to set Z-index. Here we have not used the top bottom, so it will not make any difference by putting position relative. Its position will be set. And its position is set, means there is another position after removing static, because of which I can put Z-index on it. If I remove Z-index, then it will go behind. So the static position is by default property, you know this. Position static will be seen in your CSS? Yes, sometimes we use it. Suppose I want to reset its position, I want it to be relative. So reset it when a media query comes, that is, whenever we resize it, I will tell you in the upcoming videos. I just want to tell you that we sometimes write and set position static in JavaScript. But forgetting all those things, we come to the point. We saw position static, we saw position relative. You can use top, bottom, left, right if you have put position relative. So if I reload it, nothing will happen because we were writing all these CSS here, which goes away after refreshing. So here I quickly write top 34 pixels and bottom let us say 56 pixels. And you see, from top and in fact, I have to write left here. Left or right, either I will set top or bottom, I will do one of these two. So here you see, top 34 pixels, left 56 pixels. You see, I gave it from top, I gave it from left. So I hope you understand this thing. If I want to set the Z-index of other boxes, then I will have to put position in it. But now I let it stay like this. So this came on top of it, you can see the box. So this was the position. Now I want to tell you what happens by absolute position. So what I will do is first of all, I will give a parent to all our boxes. That is, all of these will come inside a parent div. So here I have given a parent div by class is equal to parent. Let us say in this parent div, I want to write some styles. If dot parent and I want to give some padding in it, let us say 3 pixels. And I would like to give margin, let us say 34 pixels. And I make it 43 pixels. And here I give a border of 2 pixels solid purple. Let us keep this much for now. And you can see that there is a parent box in which all our other boxes are kept. So now what I will do is give it a position. I will give it to our box 1, I will give it position absolute. What will happen by giving position absolute? By giving position absolute, it will seem that this element, see I gave it position absolute, it has become that this element is not in the normal document flow. So this was my box 2, to which I had given position relative. I would like to end its position relative once, just to explain to you what is position absolute. So now you have to understand what will happen when I will absolute any position. When I absolute its position, then what will it do? I have made its position absolute, then it will not do anything. But as soon as I said position absolute top 0 pixels, you see what it will do now, it has gone to the top in viewport. You can see what it will do, it will find its parent and say, parent, are you a positioned element? Understand this carefully, what did I say? What did I do? Listen to me carefully, forget everything, whatever you were thinking, now look carefully at the screen. Div, which is box 1, in that I gave position absolute. As soon as absolute position is applied in this and top 0 pixels are applied, now it will try to find out whose 0 pixels are relative. So what will it do? It will find its parent. It will ask its parent, dad, are you a positioned element? Its dad will say, wait, I will see and come. It will see that there is no position in my class, my position is static. So it will say, dad, bye then. Then it will say, grandfather, who is its grandfather? It will say, body, grandfather, are you a positioned element? It will say no, then it will go to its dad. It will say, but grandfather, are you a positioned element? It will say, I am not a positioned element, but there is no one above me, so you are my relative here. It will say, okay, so its relative will be 0 pixels from the top. So whose relative is this? Nearest positioned ancestor. So what does position mean? Position is static, something else. Now you see here, if you don't understand what its parent is, then listen again. Here I have made the position absolute, made the top 0 pixels. If I increase the top, then it comes like this. If I make the left 0, add one more here, and I say, bro, let the left also become 0. So here the left is relative to HTML 0. So here you can see that the left has become 0. Now what will I do? If I increase the left like this, then you can see here that it is going here, because this is the distance of 144 pixels. And the top 8 pixels means it is 8 pixels from here. So the top is 8 pixels, the left is 144 pixels. I hope you understood what I am saying. When I made the position absolute, I will make it 8 pixels from the top. Because it has decided that it will move relative to HTML. So the top 8 pixels are relative to HTML, and here 144 pixels are relative to HTML. What would have happened if I had positioned the parent? That is, the parent, the dot parent class, I will do the format document. If I put the position in the dot parent class, let's say I put absolute. Now I have not set its top and bottom, so the parent will not move from anywhere. You have to take care of this. But the position is absolute, that is, the parent's position has been set. Now when it will ask, Papa, Papa, are you positioned? So its Papa will say, yes, I am the position, so you are my relative. So now the box 1, so now the box 1, that top 0 pixels will be relative to whose relative? It will be relative to its parent. Top 0 pixels will be relative to its parent. That is, if I increase it, then it will be relative to its parent. It will not be relative to HTML. You have seen this thing. And if I put left here, so that it becomes 3 pixels to the left, then you can see here that by doing left 3 pixels, and if I increase left 3 pixels, then you can see here that this is how the relative of its parent is running. So the position is absolute, what does it do? It finds its nearest parent, which is positioned. And once it has found its nearest positioned element, its relative, that top left or bottom right, bottom left, whatever is set, it sets its position accordingly. I hope everyone understood this thing. Write in the comment, I understood this thing. Now we have another property, fixed. Okay, I do one thing, I reset it again. And as we had 4 boxes, they will come as they are. I also remove the position given by the parent. And you see here that all our 4 boxes came as they were. Now if you assume that I fix the position, let's say of this third box, that is, of this box 3, I say that I want to fix the position. So if I write position here, and I write fixed, so you see the position is fixed and top, let's say, or I do bottom, bottom 0 pixels, and I do left, let's say 25 bw. Okay, if I do something like this, then what will happen? See, it came here, 25 bw has been shifted. Now I want to show you one thing here, and you know what that thing is? That thing is that it will be fixed here, no matter if I scroll this page. Now there is not so much content on this page that I can scroll it. But I can always fix that by increasing the height of the box. So where the height was 133, there I will make it 433, the height of the boxes. So you see that now I am scrolling it, so the box is set here. You see, so whatever I do, if I assume that I have to keep such a thing here, you must have seen many such sites where you guys once scroll, then below the ad or something else that is static, now I fix it a little, I bring it to the center, box 3, so what I left here, 25 bw, I will make it a little less, to bring it to the center, I will do something like this, and I will make the left 8 bw, and here I will make the left 8 bw, where did the left box 3 go, here is 8 bw, as soon as I make it 8 bw, you guys see here, and if I refresh it, then it will be here, irrespective of my other website, how it is scrolling, and if I want to set its height too, that is, I make its height also let us say 111 pixels, so you see here, I have to make it important, because I have written the box below, let me do one thing, I will put its definition above, something like this, and now see its height has changed, you can see here that my box on which I have fixed the position, it is fixed, so my box 3 is fixed, and it is fixed according to this, and I am also scrolling the page, so nothing is happening, I hope you understood, now I will tell you about position sticky, and for this I would like to take a better example, so I will show you one thing here, that the position I had put here in box 3, I will comment it out, and I will make box 1 sticky, and I will say that its position is sticky, okay, as soon as I make its position sticky, you guys see here, I will make top 0, I will have to make top 0 too, I have given 0 pixels for top, I will say that 0 pixels from top, as soon as I do this, you see it is stuck, okay, and when does this come in use, I will tell you, suppose our box is a nav bar, and its height let us say 111 pixels, and its width let us say 100%, and its margin 0, and padding 0, I would like to make padding 0 too, and you guys see that margin 0 and padding 0, this is how it is, it is in my parent obviously, but as soon as I scroll it, everything is scrolling about, so suppose this is my nav bar of this website, I know this is not a good nav bar, and we are going to make better website than this, this is just a start, I will tell you, many people were commenting in the comment that when will we make good websites, let us finish all the property, then we will make, this is the kind of website that you will also say that this is going to go up, we have raised it a little bit, and this is the target that I will teach you how to make dangerous websites, but I want to tell you some basics here, you see here, we have given a position here, sticky, sticky means something that sticks, the thing that sticks, it will stick on the wall, now you see, as soon as I scroll, it sticks, and if I come here, it will stay like this, until you scroll till this, it will not stick, so until you scroll till this, it will behave like a static position, but as soon as you scroll beyond this, as soon as you scroll beyond this, position, here by doing sticky, it sticks up, so this is position sticky, there is a lot of difference between fixed and sticky, I don't know why people say that we have confusion between fixed and sticky, according to me, fixed is different, sticky is different, this is a very popular question, if you go to stackoverflow, you will see that I am confused between fixed and sticky, but I don't think that there is going to be a lot of confusion between fixed and sticky, fixed means, the name is also telling, that you have taken 4 pages, and pasted the box here, in your screen, it is not moving from here, it is pasted here, fixed means, you fix it on the wall, by screwing, remember it like this, and sticky means, until you scroll above this, it will remain static, and as soon as you scroll above this, it will stick on the wall, as you can see, this is our sticky, the position we have given is sticky, I hope you understood this, now I want to comment on position absolute, and before commenting on it, I will remove the position sticky and top, and after removing all this, I will revert it to position absolute, so when you see box 1, its position is absolute, and this is relative to our html, and as I told you, that box 1 will check its parent, if it has a position on it, then it will be relative to its parent, as you can see, above, html and relative of body will not be set, it will be set here, now if I fixed its position, then also its position will be assumed to be on it, and you see here, its relative will be set, if I made its position sticky, means parent's position is made sticky, and the child's position is made absolute, so that child, will position itself relative to its parent, as we can see in case of box 1, we have set top 0 left 3, so top 0 left 3 will be relative to the parent, as parent is positioned, now whether it is positioned by position fixed, whether it is positioned by position sticky, whether it is positioned by position absolute, or if it is positioned by position relative, then also it will work relative to its parent, but there is one exception in this, and it can introduce some weird bugs in your code, if you don't know, transform, filter, or perspective properties, can also make an element appear as positioned, okay, if I set perspective property on transform filter, then also it will assume parent as positioned, what is the meaning of this, and what is this weird thing, I will tell you, suppose I didn't make it positioned, suppose I didn't make it positioned relative, its child has position absolute, listen carefully, if you don't pay attention, then you won't understand, I guarantee you, before you say, I don't understand, because these things are very audible, watch the video again, here I said that I have not used any kind of positioning in this, so it will set itself as relative to body, or you can say it as relative to HTML, so it will set itself as relative to body, it will go on top of the document, according to that, it will follow top 0 and left 3 pixels, but if I set it as relative to position, then what will happen, then it will be relative to its parent, but there is one more exception, when it will be relative to its parent, if I put a transform property on it, about which I have not told you, I know that, I have not told you about transform property, so what I will do, I will make it translate 0, I will tell you about translate transform properties in the coming videos, but for now, you assume that it is a property, if this property is there, then also see what happened, it is being relative to its parent, so here, these three properties are the exception, which very few people tell, and I have not seen this thing anywhere, I have felt it, there was a bug in my code, after that I saw here and there, so I did not get the answer of stack overflow, I got the comment, I got to know about it, I am telling you a long time ago, and if the filter property is also there, like a filter property, filter and invert, assume I put invert filter, and you see here, by inverting filter, basically what happens, color is inverted, by putting invert filter, and if I make invert 0, then I guess nothing happens, so here you see, as soon as I made invert 0, so this box is in relative position of its parent, but if we do not know this thing, that these three properties can also make it look like a position element, then we may be cheated, and interviewers also ask this thing, that we will put invert filter on your parent, or any kind of filter, and will ask you, that tell me, this box will position itself in relative position of topmost HTML relative, or relative position of this parent, and if you do not know all these things, then it is possible that it will be in relative position of HTML, because it does not have position, but if filter is there, then also it will position itself in relative position of this parent, I hope it is clear, you are understanding the thing, same goes for perspective property also, if I set perspective property, so I have made perspective 0m, and you can see, this is relative position of parent, which means, these three properties can also make it look like a position element, I hope that makes sense, for now I will remove it, but these three properties, you have to keep in mind, I will put it up, and here is an exception, I will write it as an exception, it is a very important exception, and with this, our position property is finished, I hope you enjoyed it, and you must have also said that it is fun, after listening to all these properties, because by using position, by using z-index, you can make your element appear anywhere, if you want that one particular element comes above all, increase its z-index, you want that one particular element is below one and above another, then you set the value of z-index according to this, that the one who has the most value in z-index, will come above all, and the one who has the least value, will be below all, so in this way you play around with z-index, and I hope you enjoyed this course, if you have not accessed it yet, then do the playlist, and I am updating source code daily, and here by doing 0 and 1, it came so beautiful, do you agree or not, that's all for now, access the playlist, and like the video, and if you have not named your village and uncle's land, then send it in the papers, thank you so much guys for watching this video, and I will see you next time. Thank you."}
