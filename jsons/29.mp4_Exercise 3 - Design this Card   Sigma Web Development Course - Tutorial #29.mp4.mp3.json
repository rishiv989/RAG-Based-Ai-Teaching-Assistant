I told you that in exercise 3, we are going to do something that will be used in actual. That means you will see such things while building yourself. When you build websites for actual clients. If you have decided that you are going to solve this question, then write Challenge Accepted in the comment section below. I am very excited as usual. Let's see how much strength is in this exercise. Let's roll the intro. So, friends, you can mark the topic of today's video. Because today we are going to start something very interesting. We will start actual development. I will show you a card PNG here. And you have to make this card. This is today's exercise. I am not going to do much written here. But let's do it. It is also necessary to do a little formality. Now, what will I do here? I want to open this folder in VS Code. So, I will open it by right-clicking on the shift key. And here you will see an index.html. I will put it here. And I will put a comment for you by putting a boilerplate. I will put a comment here. Card.png is a file which contains a card image. Write HTML and CSS code to design this card. Okay, understood? Everyone write in the comment that it is okay, understood. Okay, everyone has to write in the comment. Understood or not? And if the challenge is accepted, then you have to write. And here you have to make a card like card.png. Now, if you have accepted the challenge, will it be done or not? Do you have confidence? Tell me in the comment section below. See, you can use any image instead of this image. Okay, and I want exactly the same card without compromise. This card image is an image. You have to write its code. And here you can also put some text. You put your text. There is no need to put any lorem here. Then here read more. Okay, now I have not told you exactly what is its color code, what is its color code, what is its length, what is its height. So make this card approximately. Okay, the image should not be bad. I am telling you in advance. It should not be that the aspect ratio of the image is bad. That will not be accepted. I will disqualify you. Okay, so if you do not want to be disqualified, then make it well. Do it well, okay. If you do it well, then you will also get a shoutout. Now see here Lago de Braise is written. How will you bring this nature and this lake capsule? Now if you do it, if you have written the challenge accepted, then start doing it and post your solution too. Now I will tell you that when you post the solution, then use this hashtag. HTML, okay. Hashtag HTML. Today's hashtag is hashtag HTML. Post your solution using hashtag HTML so that I can search with this hashtag and I will know that you have posted the solution of this problem. Now let's do a little discussion. For those people who have lost their courage after seeing this, how will this be done? I tell you, you stay with me. It is better to listen to me than not to do this exercise. But if you have accepted the challenge, then start doing it without listening. If possible, then you can listen to me after posting this solution. See here you see that I have made a div. But let's say, okay. I will give the border radius in it. See how much border radius you have to give. You can give a set height to that div or not. I will tell you what is the meaning of this. Okay, I made this card. After this, what will I do inside this div? I will put an image and I will do the border radius and I will give padding in it so that it makes a little distance. After this, I will give the URL of this image. And please use a public URL. Use an image that is on the net. And by putting this image here, I will give only the width or height of the image. Because if I give only that much, it will be fine, it will come inside it. After this, this div is over here. I will put an image inside a div. I will start another div in which I will make these capsules of nature and lake. I will make this with the help of span so that it stays in line. After this, I will put an H1 here. I will put a heading or H2 here. Because I will assume that on whichever page this card is going to go, the main heading will be H1. And this will be H2 heading. And here I will use paragraph tag. Then I will put another div in which I will put a button. Inside that div, I will center the text line so that it is centered. And in the coming videos, you will get the solution to this. And I will also give a shoutout to the heroes. Those people who must have solved this problem. So if you have not yet accessed the Sigma Web Development playlist, then you can click here and bookmark it. Or click here and save it. Now I want to tell you one thing here. It is decided that the Sigma course is a very good free course for you. A lot of people are praising it. You have given a lot of love. But there are some people in the industry who are not happy with the freeing of the Sigma course. I have told you before and I will tell you now that I am not against any kind of paid course. But Sigma is a very dangerous HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Development course. It is a complete course. No one can deny this. This is a very universal fact. And a lot of people feel bad that I bought a paid course. First, I am getting such a good course for free. So cut your losses and do it. And a lot of people are talking a lot about me here and there. And they are contacting me. And indirectly they are targeting me. And they are saying that this is like this. And the things I don't even want to discuss. That this is useless. What is useful and what is useless. The world knows. And there is no need to justify it. There is no need for evidence. With this, access the playlist. Focus more on your learning. That's all for now in this video. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Music."}
