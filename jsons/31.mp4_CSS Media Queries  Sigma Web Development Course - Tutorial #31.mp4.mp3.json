But today, by default, if anyone makes a website from you, then you have to make it responsive. This is the default setting. The most important thing for responsiveness is media query for which you have to write some additional code and your website on the desktop will also adapt for mobile phones. To make your website look good on mobile, you will have to use media queries which are very simple and have a very straightforward syntax. Like the video in the comment section below and write Sigma batch op. I am very excited as always. Let's go to the computer stream. Let's roll the intro. So guys, to save time, I have opened my VS code here and already made a file with the name index.html. I have given a title to this page with the name CSS Media Query. And here I will tell you what is media query. I will put a very strange style here and I will say I will say, color the background of the body red. And you will say, the background color of the body is red, I do it. And inside the div, I will write, hey, I am a red body guy. Who am I? Red body guy. I mean, not the red body, but the body tag is red. So this means that if you have not accessed the Sigma web development playlist, then access the playlist, sometimes click here and save it. And also access the GitHub code. Now see what we have to do is obviously preview it. And after previewing it, you will say, yes, it's okay, what is the time pass, the body has turned red, it's a very good thing, applause. But what I have come to tell you today is that you can change styles. On which device are you on, on that basis. See, I will tell you a little story. I will tell you a story like Dadaji tells his grandson that this used to happen in our time. See, it used to happen, I don't know my time, but when CSS 2 came a long time ago, then a query called media was introduced. So its purpose was only that the media query used to tell that if any person is accessing the website on another device, then the styles can be changed. It was just this purpose. It was called media rule, which was introduced in CSS 2. In CSS 3, the name of this media rule was changed to media query. So forget how the media rule worked in CSS 2. In CSS 3, I tell you how the media query works. So what is the syntax of media query in CSS 3? First of all, you write at the rate media. This means that you are writing a media query. Now after this, you tell me which device you want to write the media query in. And before that, a not or only comes. That is, I can write media only screen here. That is, it will be applied here only if it is on the screen. So a typical syntax of media query looks like this. We write media not or only. Either don't show it on this media type or show it only if it is a media type. And after that, we write some expressions here, which I will tell you about. And we write CSS code in it, which will be applied only when this thing is satisfied. Okay, now I will tell you how you can use it. So here I will write media. In most of the cases, we write only because we want this media to be a match only when we are on the screen. When the media type is screen. What other media types are there, you can put all. That is, on all media types. Then you can put print. Which is a printer, etc. If the website is being viewed, then you will see it. Another media type is screen, which is the most common in the phone, laptop, or in your iPad, etc. If you are showing, then it is a screen. There is another speech device, which is used for those people who cannot see. So here speech is put. If you want this CSS style to be applied only when there is a speech device here, then you will write speech here. But in most of the cases, you will write screen here only. And after that, you will write end here. And you will write a condition like this. For example, I write max width should be 455 pixels. And suppose I want that if this happens, then the background color of the body should be red. So I do one thing, I will write body here. And I will write in the body that I will make the background color blue. Here I make the background color blue. So if the max width is 45 pixels, then the background color will be blue. So I will show you what it means. I will make it smaller, smaller, smaller. Here you can see the width. I will make it smaller, smaller, smaller. Now you see, if its max width is up to 455 pixels, then this style will be applied. That is, if it is smaller than 455, then this style will be applied. And if it is bigger than 455, then the styles taught in it will not be applied. So this is how media query works. And this is 90% media query as far as I have told you. This is the syntax. You will find yourself applying this syntax in 90 to 95% of the cases. Media only screen and max width 455 or whatever the max width is. I can also give min width here. If I make it min width here, then what will happen? If I make it min width, then it will be applied after how many pixels I gave. How many pixels did I give? I guess I gave 455 pixels. Now you can see here that this media query has been enabled. Because the width is more than 455 pixels. If I reduce it, then this media query will be gone. It will also disappear from here. That is, there is no existence of this media query. These CSS styles will not be applied. So this media query is not visible. As soon as I increase it, it says that this media query has been activated. So these styles will not work. That's all about media query. So to summarize, the media query is used to make responsive designs. For example, let's say I have two boxes. I make two boxes here. And I will do div.boxes. And here I will do div.box. And I put some more boxes. And here in the div.box, I will say that the width of the div.box is 344 pixels. And I want to keep the height to 344 pixels. By the way, why did I choose 344 pixels for this example? If you have any idea, then tell me which Isaac Newton's mind I used 344 pixels. Why didn't I do 392 pixels? Do tell me in the comment section below if you know. And you can see that I have only given the width of the box. I also give the background color. And I give the background color to steel blue. I have given the background color to steel blue. You will get to see these boxes. I also give padding and margin. So if I give padding 3 pixels, and margin 3 pixels, then you can see that after giving padding and margin, it looks like this. Now let's say I want these boxes to look like this. Let's say these boxes on small screens look like this. So that they start wrapping themselves. Let's say I want this to be a flex box. I know I have not told you about flex box. I am just flexing it to give you an example. If you don't know what a flex box is, then don't worry. I will tell you very well about flex box. But you just understand that by applying display flex, it will come in such a container. Now I will make it smaller. You see, they are getting smaller like this. Now I am making it smaller. Let's say when this red break point is coming, 388 pixels are coming, then I will tell you to make the flex direction column. This is just an example that I am giving you. This is not the best way to do this. I will tell you. I will tell you to make the flex direction column. So what will happen by doing this? As soon as I make it smaller, now see I did this. Oops, I have actually made a mistake here. I will make it max width. I will not make it min width. I will not make it min width. Now see, it looks like this. Now as soon as it is small, you see it came like this. So what can I say? I can say that the phone, the devices smaller than this, whatever number I gave here, apply this CSS in them. Now what happens is that when you are doing responsive design, then you understand the concept of break points. We break our website in 2-3 break points. We say that the phone devices should be below 455 pixels. This is an arbitrary number. You can take a good approximation of this number. But I am telling you an example. The devices bigger than 455 pixels will be let us say from 455 to 750. We consider them as tablets. They will be like tablets somewhere. And we will apply some more styles in them. Then the devices above that, let us say up to 1080 pixels, we will say that 1920 or then we will say that 1920 or then whatever pixels are there in our wide screen, up to that, a particular style will be applied. Then there are some ultra wide monitors whose width is very high. In them also, we want to show our website in a different way. So in those ultra wide monitors, we can decorate our website with some more media queries. We can style it. So I hope everyone understood media query. Now I will use media query when we make projects. And I will use media query a lot. So whenever you are writing raw CSS, you will definitely use media query. If you are using frameworks, then while using frameworks, you will not use media query because frameworks are behind the hood. Like tailwind CSS, it uses media queries behind the hood. But we will write raw CSS. We will make projects in raw CSS. You guys see there how I will use media query. Now before going, I want to show you one more thing. That there is a media query which you guys use. I will write here and and I will write orientation. Orientation. Suppose I will say landscape. When our orientation is landscape, then suppose I want to color background purple. Whose background color I want to make purple? Body. Suppose I want to do something like this. I color the body purple. Not background color, I make color purple. So I made body color purple. When did I make it purple? I have not written anything about body color. In fact, I will do one thing. I will put a border in the body. 2 pixels solid purple. Now suppose I did this. Now you can see 2 pixels solid purple. You can see this when my orientation is landscape. But if my orientation is portrait then it will disappear. What does portrait mean? Portrait means that the height, this is portrait. This height is more than width. If width is more than height, then it is landscape. So if it is landscape, then this border is visible. You can also do orientation landscape or portrait. So if I did portrait here, then this line will be visible in portrait. You can see that this border is visible only in portrait. So if you want your styles to be enabled in landscape or portrait, then you can use this. This media query is also very popular. But I am telling you again, in most of the cases, you will find this media query in most of the cases. With that said, if you have not accessed the playlist yet, then I am coming to your house. I will update the source code. You can access it. Like the video, share the playlist, share the video and give your land to me. Thank you so much guys for watching this video.
